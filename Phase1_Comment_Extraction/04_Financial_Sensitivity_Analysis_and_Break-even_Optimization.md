### **4. Financial Sensitivity Analysis & Break-even Optimization**

* **Open Questions:**

  * Can I save costs by being the admin/manager?
  * Would it be better to hire a Thai manager? At what salary — 30k? *(Staffing Model Decision)*
  * Is the "90k/month" expense an aggregate, or broken down (truck, crew, facility, admin)? *(Financial Clarification Needed)*
* **Action:**

  * Actually, don't rely on material resale — service fees are main target. *(Business Model Re-focus)*
  * Verify average number of units per building for accurate forecasting. *(Market Data Research)*
* **Suggestion:**

  * Aim for 12 buildings × 600 units, or 400 units × 12 buildings × 50 THB/unit for break-even. *(Revenue Target)*
  * Verify 90k/month in expenses. *(Finance Verification)*
