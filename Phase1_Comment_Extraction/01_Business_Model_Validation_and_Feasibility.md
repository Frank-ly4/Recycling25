### **1. Business Model Validation & Feasibility**

* **Action/Note:**

  * Make it clear we don't expect to be profitable from reselling plastic but from *fees*. Resale is a bonus, possibly for employee bonuses. *(Action Item / Clarification)*
  * Can we secure contracts not dependent on participation? E.g., charge condos per room even if residents don't use the service. *(Open Question / Sales Model to Research)*
  * Could use lobby displays to show impact metrics for each building. *(Idea / Marketing Action)*
* **Suggestion:**

  * Partnering with *saleng* (informal collectors) may be key; differentiation + collaboration. *(Strategy Suggestion)*
