## Recycling25 — Bangkok Condo Recycling Service

This repository contains a complete, execution-ready business plan and operating playbook for launching a tech-enabled recycling service for condominium buildings in Bangkok, Thailand.

The project is organized for action: clear business plan, legal/permit checklists, SOPs, financial assumptions, go-to-market materials, and an investor-ready data room index.

### Directory structure

- `docs/BusinessPlan/` — the authoritative business plan (modular by section)
- `docs/GoToMarket/` — sales one-pager, deck outline, contract/SLA and reporting templates
- `legal/` — permits and structure choices (Thai-majority vs BOI), Social Enterprise guide
- `ops/` — SOPs for collection, sorting, health & safety, crisis comms; logistics notes
- `finance/` — financial assumptions, break-even scenarios, funding strategy
- `investors/` — data room index and tranche-based term guidance
- `research/` — pending questions and verified findings (source of truth)
- `archive/` — links to legacy notes kept for provenance

### Quick start

1) Read `docs/BusinessPlan/00_Business_Plan.md` end-to-end.

2) Execute the 14-day validation sprint in `docs/GoToMarket/01_Validation_Sprint.md`.

3) In parallel, action `legal/01_Legal_Checklist_Thailand.md` (Thai-majority now, BOI parallel; apply SE).

4) Use `docs/GoToMarket/` templates for outreach (one-pager, deck, pilot SLA, 12-month service agreement) and `ops/SOPs` to run pilots.

5) Track assumptions and update `finance/` based on pilot actuals; prepare `investors/Data_Room_Index.md` for tranche-based funding.

### Notes

- Existing research and plans remain in-place and are indexed under `archive/` for reference.
- All new edits should update the modular plan in `docs/BusinessPlan/` and the corresponding checklist/SOPs.
