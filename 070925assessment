Recycling25 — Business Plan Audit (Sections 1–9)

Date: 2025-09-07

## Section 1 – Clarity & Feasibility

| Area | Issue/Flag | Why it matters | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Break-even targets | 4–6 condos at 80–100 THB/unit vs 150–160k THB monthly cost | Margin is tight; sensitivity to price/units likely high; quantify per-scenario break-even | §1, §8 |
| Price strategy | Fee bands (80–100 THB) lack criteria or guardrails | Prevent underpricing and scope creep | §4 |
| Route clustering | “2–3 adjacent districts” not quantified (km, stop counts, time windows) | Ops feasibility, fuel/labor depend on it | §1, §5 |
| Vehicle choice | FRR/N-series feasibility in condo docks/ramps not validated | Access constraints could force fleet change | §5 |
| Facility size | 150–300 m² adequacy not tied to tonnage/throughput | Risk of overflow/inefficiency without sizing math | §5 |
| Staffing model | “Driver + loader; shared sorting” vs sorting needs | Throughput may require dedicated sorters | §5 |
| SLA claims | “SLA-backed reliability” lacks specific metrics (response time, miss rate) | Sales credibility and penalties hinge on metrics | §3, §7 |
| Bonus revenue | Materials/EPR/sponsorships framed as revenue without probabilities | Avoid overestimation; treat as optional | §4 |
| Legal scaling | “No DIW license <50 hp & <50 employees” vs scale to 15–20 buildings | Licensing risk if thresholds exceeded | §1, §5–§6, §10 |
| Funding “Ask” | Tranche-based seed unspecified (amount/use of proceeds by phase) | Hard to evaluate feasibility/timeline | §1, §10 |

## Section 2 – Data & Research Gaps

| Missing data | Why needed | Where referenced |
|---|---|---|
| Addressable ICP count per target districts | TAM/SAM and route density | §2, §7 |
| Competitor price benchmarks (formal/informal) | Validate -30% undercut risk; pricing guardrails | §8–§9 |
| Condo access constraints (dock sizes/ramp grades) | Vehicle feasibility (FRR vs N-series) | §5 |
| Route model (km/day, stops, dwell time) | Fuel/labor validation | §5 |
| Tonnage per building/month by stream | Throughput, facility sizing, labor needs | §3, §5, §8 |
| Bale specs and processor price sheets/MOUs | Materials revenue realism, QA standards | §4, §9 |
| Facility rent quotes (150–300 m²) + zoning | Opex validation, compliance | §5 |
| Labor benchmarks (driver/loader/sorter total comp) | Validate 45–70k THB line | §5, §8 |
| Insurance/PDPA compliance costs | Opex and compliance readiness | §6, §9 |
| Permit list with timelines (BMA, DLT, SSO) | Critical path for pilot start | §1, §6, §10 |
| SLA metrics (KPIs, credits/penalties) | Sales kit credibility and ops targets | §7 |
| Funding plan with tranches and uses | Cash runway and milestones | §1, §10 |

## Section 3 – Assumption Validation

| Claim | Validation needed | Suggested sources | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| BMA “No Mixed Waste” fee 20 vs 60 THB | Confirm current rates and enforcement | BMA regs/official notices | §2 |
| No DIW factory license if <50 hp & <50 employees | Verify thresholds and revised Factory Act details | DIW, Factory Act (2019+) | §1, §6 |
| SE certification enables 100% investor tax deduction | Confirm eligibility, investor deduction mechanics | Thai Social Enterprise Act; Revenue Dept. | §1, §6 |
| BOI promotion viable for this model | Confirm activity category, incentives, Thai-majority constraints | BOI activity list; BOI officer consult | §1, §6 |
| Fuel 9.5–15k THB/month with clustering | Validate vs modeled km and truck fuel rate | Route model; truck spec sheets | §5, §8 |
| Labor 45–70k THB/month | Benchmark wages incl. SSO, OT, turnover | MOL stats; job boards; payroll firms | §5, §8 |
| Facility 150–300 m² adequate | Throughput math: tonnage, dwell, bale density | Ops model; layout mock | §5 |
| 10–30k THB materials revenue/month | Validate via processor quotes and bale yield | Price sheets; trial MOUs | §4, §8 |
| -30% undercut is primary risk | Verify competitor pricing, bundle differences | Market scan, 3–5 condo interviews | §8–§9 |
| 4–6 condos break-even at 80–100 THB | Full unit-econ and sensitivity table | Finance model | §1, §8 |

## Section 4 – Document Cohesion

| Issue Type | Description | Sections Affected | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pricing Inconsistency | §4 offers lump-sum/rev-share options but §8 models per-unit only | §4, §8 | Financial projections incomplete |
| Scale Mismatch | “Comfortable at 8–10” vs roadmap jump to “15–20” | §1, §10 | Growth path unclear |
| Staffing Evolution Gap | “Small bench” but no scaling plan for sorting staff | §5, §8 | Labor cost projections unreliable |
| Legal Timeline Conflict | “Ltd now; BOI in parallel” but roadmap lacks legal sequencing | §1, §6, §10 | Compliance risk for pilot |
| Revenue Model Overlap | Materials sales labeled “bonus” yet included in examples | §1, §4, §8 | Mixed viability messaging |
| Geographic Scope Drift | “2–3 adjacent districts” vs listing non-adjacent areas | §1, §7 | Route efficiency compromised |
| Tech Stack Ambiguity | “Simple tech” without specs or roadmap milestones | §3, §10 | Implementation undefined |

## Section 6 – Risks & Weak Points

| Category | Specific Risk | Current Mitigation | Weakness | Suggested Enhancement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Market | Competitor 30% undercut | SLA/compliance/referrals | No pricing floor or moat | Exclusive terms, prepay discounts, bundled services |
| Operational | Vehicle access constraints | — | Could invalidate fleet choice | Pre-pilot site surveys; backup vehicle config |
| Financial | Materials price volatility | “Baling for premiums” | No hedging/floor prices | Min-price contracts; diversified buyers |
| Legal | DIW threshold breach at scale | — | Could halt operations | Subsidiary structure; trigger-based licensing |
| Participation | Low resident engagement | Bags/education/incentives | No baselines/metrics | Pilot participation targets; A/B tests |
| Cash Flow | Collection delays | Deposits; Net-15 | No bad debt provision | Credit checks; auto-pay; factoring option |
| Reputational | Contamination incident | Crisis comms; insurance | No prevention protocols | Contamination SOPs; training cert; audits |
| Partnership | Processor reliability | Spec sheets; MOUs | No backups | ≥3 processors; performance SLAs |
| Regulatory | BMA policy change | — | Single demand driver | Value prop beyond compliance; multi-district permits |
| Technology | Data loss/breach | PDPA mentioned | No concrete controls | Retention policy; access controls; backups |

Critical vulnerabilities: dependence on BMA fee, tight margins, weak moat, scaling cliff at DIW thresholds.

## Section 7 – Branch Analysis (Impact vs. Effort)

| Branch | Description | Impact | Effort | Risks/Notes | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pricing model | Per-unit vs lump-sum vs reduced-fee + rev-share | High | Medium | Margin leakage with rev-share | Pursue per-unit primary; test lump-sum with guardrails; postpone rev-share |
| Geography focus | Single micro-cluster vs multi-district | High | Medium | Route inefficiency if spread | Pursue single micro-cluster; postpone multi-district |
| Fleet choice | N-series vs FRR | High | Medium | Dock/ramp constraints | Pursue N-series baseline pending surveys; postpone FRR |
| Facility footprint | 150–300 m²; when to add baler | Medium | Medium | Over/under-sizing risk | Pursue 150–200 m²; postpone baler until throughput threshold |
| Materials revenue | Reliance on bale sales | Medium | Low | Price volatility | Pursue MOUs; cap materials at ≤20% plan; hedge |
| Tech stack | Route optimization/data capture | Medium | Medium | Overbuild risk | Pursue minimal off-the-shelf; postpone custom dev |
| Legal incentives | SE + BOI | Medium | High | Time/eligibility risk | Pursue SE now; postpone BOI till post-pilot |
| Sales kit | One-pager, deck, ESG template | Medium | Low | Credibility risk if absent | Pursue immediately |
| Fundraising | Tranche-based seed | High | Medium | Dilution/timing | Pursue with milestone gates |
| Scale target | 15–20 buildings | High | High | Ops strain/legal thresholds | Postpone until 8–10 stable |

## Section 8 – Next Solo Steps (5–7 sequential actions)

1) Build a 50–80 condo prospect list within one micro-cluster (name, units, contact).
2) Draft bilingual outreach script + email, and a one-page LOI template.
3) Call/contact 10–15 managers to capture price sensitivity and service scope needs.
4) Schedule and conduct 3–5 vehicle access surveys; document dock/ramps/turn radii.
5) Obtain ≥3 facility quotes and ≥2 vehicle quotes; record terms and lead times.
6) Draft PDPA policy + simple data capture template for pilot reporting.
7) Define pilot SLA/KPIs and prepare a short pilot agreement template.
