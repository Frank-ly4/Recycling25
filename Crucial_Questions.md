# Crucial Questions to Address

**Date:** 2025-06-11

This document lists the most critical strategic questions that must be answered to establish a viable business plan.

### Financial Viability
1.  What is the detailed, line-item breakdown of the estimated 90k/month in operational expenses?
2.  Based on realistic cost and revenue projections, what is the true break-even point (e.g., number of buildings or units required)?
3.  How can the financial model be structured to ensure stability even with fluctuating resident participation rates?

### Legal & Compliance
1.  Are we eligible for a Foreign Business License (FBL) with fewer than 50 employees? What are the specific criteria, costs, and timelines for the application process?
2.  Which specific business, vehicle, or facility licenses have requirements (e.g., employee count, equipment specifications) that we currently do not meet?

### Operations & Staffing
1.  What are the pros, cons, and cost implications of self-managing the operation initially versus hiring a local Thai manager?
2.  What is the best model for integrating with the existing cleaning staff in condos? Should it be a collaboration, a profit-sharing arrangement, or a different approach to avoid conflict and ensure smooth operations?
