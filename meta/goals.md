## Project goals and constraints

Targets (initial, pilot phase)
- Diversion rate: ≥ 25% of eligible recyclables captured per building
- Contamination: ≤ 5% (by weight) at facility intake
- Cost per ton handled: ≤ 2,000 THB (pilot), trending to ≤ 1,500 THB with density
- On-time pickups: ≥ 98% within agreed windows
- Bin overflow rate: ≤ 3% of weekly checks
- Participation: ≥ 30% of units engaging by week 8
- CO2e avoided: tracked and reported monthly (standard factors)
- NPS: ≥ +30 from condo managers by end of pilot

Constraints
- Fees-first model; materials revenue is bonus
- Operate legally: BMA permit, DLT registration, PDPA compliance
- Route clustering within 2–3 adjacent districts
- Lean capex; tranche-based funding; reversible changes preferred
