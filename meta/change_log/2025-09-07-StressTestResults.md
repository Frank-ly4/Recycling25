# 2025-09-07 â€” Stress Test Results and Methodology

Summary:
- Completed claude-4-opus stress testing on pricing tiers
- Created comprehensive stress test document with sensitivity grids
- Established go/no-go heuristics by access tier
- Identified 50% tier @90 THB with 5-6 buildings as optimal for Bangkok launch

Files Created:
- docs/GoToMarket/Pricing_Stress_Test_0907.md (new)

Key Findings:
- 25% tier too risky (needs 9 buildings if competitor undercuts)
- 50% tier resilient to single stress factors
- Combined worst case adds 16k THB/month to costs
- Minimum viable cluster: 5 buildings at 50% tier
