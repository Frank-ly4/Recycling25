# 2025-09-07 — Action Plan, Constitution, and Config Updates

Summary:
- Added dependency-based action plan: `070925_action_plan.md`.
- Created project constitution: `CONSTITUTION.md`.
- Updated `config/constitution.json` to enforce persistence, dependency view, and change-log-first.
- Canonical assessment saved: `070925assessment`.

Files Changed:
- 070925_action_plan.md (new)
- CONSTITUTION.md (new)
- config/constitution.json (updated)
- 070925assessment (existing; reference only)

Decisions:
- Change log is updated first for substantive work.
- Per-unit pricing primary; micro-cluster focus; N-series baseline; materials ≤20%; SE now, BOI later.

Next:
- Optionally generate templates: SLA/KPIs, pricing guardrails, LOI, PDPA.
