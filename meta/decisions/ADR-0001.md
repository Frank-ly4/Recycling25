# ADR-0001 â€” Meta system adoption and execution structure

Date: 2025-08-10

Context
- Project needed an execution-first, measurable structure with persistence and KPIs.

Decision
- Adopt /meta, /modules, /pilots, /config scaffold; enforce metaprompting/self-learning via constitution.json; use fees-first model; Thai-majority now + BOI parallel; pursue SE.

Consequences
- All sessions must update state, append discoveries, and log issues; changes traceable; KPIs measurable.
