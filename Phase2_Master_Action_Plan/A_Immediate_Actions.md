### **A. Immediate Actions (“Do Now”)**

1. **Clarify Business Model**

   * Explicitly state to all stakeholders: *core revenue is from service fees, not material resale*.
   * Prepare public/marketing materials to support this.
2. **Financial Verification**

   * Break down the 90k/month expense estimate (truck, crew, facility, admin, etc.).
   * Verify average units/building for target market (pull real condo data).
   * Test break-even math for at least two scenarios (400 vs. 600 units/building; 10 vs. 12 buildings).
3. **Legal/Compliance Checklist**

   * Draft a checklist for all licenses, registrations, and permits required (company, BOI, BMA, vehicle, facility).
   * Identify which licenses *require* >50 employees or >50hp equipment — flag gaps.
   * Research process and criteria for Foreign Business License (Section 17 FBA).
   * Start documenting compliance with vehicle registration, insurance, safety, local ordinances.
4. **Service and Stakeholder Design**

   * Design service contracts so fees are not tied to individual participation — charge per room/building.
   * Map roles of condo cleaners/staff; create models for collaboration or profit sharing, not competition.
   * Develop clear impact metric dashboards/displays for client lobbies.
