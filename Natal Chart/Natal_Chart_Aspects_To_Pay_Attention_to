2. Natal Chart Aspects to Pay More Attention To
These are the placements that, if consciously integrated, can help you grow most efficiently.

A. North Node in Scorpio (2nd House)
Theme: Learning to share power, deepen intimacy, and embrace transformation—moving away from “safe” self-reliance or material focus toward deeper, riskier growth.

Growth Potential: Embrace change rather than resisting it. Let others in, even if it feels vulnerable. Build something with people, not just for them.

B. Saturn in Pisces (5th House)
Theme: Allowing yourself more joy, spontaneity, and self-expression. Not everything needs to be “practical” or “worthy”—some things are worth doing just for the pleasure or for your own creative growth.

Growth Potential: Pursue creative projects without worrying about “usefulness.” Reconnect with your own playfulness and stop overthinking the “point” of hobbies.

C. Venus Square Neptune
Theme: Romantic idealism can lead to disappointment or self-sacrifice.

Growth Potential: Practice discernment in relationships; see people as they are, not just as you wish they’d be. Examine old patterns where you give too much or chase fantasy.

D. Moon Opposite Saturn
Theme: Emotional self-protection and fear of being let down or not enough. Can lead to a kind of guardedness or pessimism about closeness.

Growth Potential: Work on receiving care as much as giving it. Allow yourself to trust and risk emotional exposure.
