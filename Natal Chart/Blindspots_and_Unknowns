3. Blindspots and Unknowns
These are chart placements/themes you may underplay, overlook, or unconsciously act out.

A. Libra Rising (Ascendant)
Blindspot: While you present as agreeable and diplomatic, you might downplay your own needs to “keep the peace” or over-accommodate others, leading to resentment or a lack of boundaries.

Reflection: Are you too quick to take on the mediator role? Do you sometimes defer important decisions or let others dictate direction just to keep things smooth?

B. Lilith in Aries (7th House)
Blindspot: Fear of fully asserting yourself in partnerships, or attracting “power struggle” dynamics.

Reflection: Do you hold back from expressing your true wants in relationships out of fear of appearing “too much” or selfish?

C. Uranus in Capricorn Square Ascendant
Blindspot: Your need for independence and change can create instability in how you present yourself to the world. Sometimes you may not realize how much you shake things up for others—or yourself—by constantly reinventing or disrupting routines.

Reflection: Are there areas where you need to stick with the boring stuff longer to see lasting results?
