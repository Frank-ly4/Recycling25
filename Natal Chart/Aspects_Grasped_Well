4. Aspects/Traits You Grasp Well Through Lived Actions
Sun in Aries (6th): You act on your ideas, start projects, and put yourself at the center of your work-life journey.

Mercury-Mars Conjunction in Pisces: You can be energetic, creative, and communicate your passions, both in written and spoken forms (teaching, mentoring, project proposals).

Jupiter in Scorpio (1st): You’re willing to go deep, to transform, and to approach life with intensity and a willingness to heal, explore, and push boundaries.

Uranus/Neptune 3rd House: You excel at self-education, innovation, and seeing patterns where others don’t—your ability to jump into new fields, combine disparate interests, and see “the meta view” is a real strength.
