1. Highest Correlations: Natal Chart vs. Lived Experience
A. Sun in Aries (6th House)
Life Correlation: Your identity is built on what you do—projects, jobs, and hands-on efforts. The 6th house is work, service, and daily routine; Aries is action, independence, and directness. You throw yourself into new ventures (recycling business, vending machines, app projects), thrive on challenge, and prefer to create your own structure rather than follow someone else’s.

Lived Example: Your recurring need for meaningful, self-driven work; your discomfort with arbitrary rules or KPIs; your sensitivity to criticism about your work output.

B. Moon in Virgo (11th House)
Life Correlation: You need to feel useful, prefer to “fix” things (systems, people, ideas), and are most emotionally grounded when helping others or improving something tangible. The 11th house adds a “group” layer: friend networks, causes, teams.

Lived Example: You naturally mentor friends, are the go-to for advice, and want your group connections to be both functional and meaningful—but sometimes you feel let down by “surface level” socializing.

C. Mercury in Pisces, Moon-Mercury-Saturn T-Square
Life Correlation: Your mind is both imaginative and analytical, but there’s ongoing tension between emotional perception (Moon), rational logic (Mercury), and inner limitation or seriousness (Saturn). You often self-analyze and seek meaning behind events.

Lived Example: Your struggle to balance gut/feeling with analysis (as seen in your trading—intuitive strategies vs. hard data), your tendency toward deep reflection, and sometimes, self-criticism.

D. Venus in Aries Square Neptune
Life Correlation: Attraction to passionate, sometimes complicated or idealistic relationships. You may chase excitement, and sometimes see partners/people as you wish them to be rather than as they are.

Lived Example: Your past romantic experiences, including chasing after “potential” or getting wrapped up in intensity even when you know it may not work long-term.

E. Uranus/Neptune in Capricorn, 3rd House
Life Correlation: Unorthodox, nonlinear learning style; periodic dives into big, weird, or tech-driven projects; need for creative mental stimulation; possible restlessness with traditional academics.

Lived Example: Your app development path, self-education via MOOCs, need for novelty, tendency to lose focus on projects if they become rote.
