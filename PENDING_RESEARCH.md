### Phase 2 Research Questions (Derived from Plan 2.0)

#### 1. Legal & Administrative

-   **Question:** What are the exact BMA (Bangkok Metropolitan Administration) permits required for a small-scale waste sorting facility? What is the application process and who is the specific contact department?

#### 2. Financial & Funding

-   **Question:** What are the current commercial interest rates and typical requirements for vehicle and equipment financing/loans for SMEs in Thailand?
-   **Question:** Can we obtain firm, itemized quotes from 2-3 insurance providers for a comprehensive business insurance package covering property, commercial vehicles, public liability, and workers' compensation for a team of 4?
-   **Question:** What are the standard payment terms for large recycling processors like Wongpanit? (e.g., Net-30, Net-60, payment on delivery?) This will affect our cash flow projections.

#### 3. Market & Sales

-   **Question:** Can we conduct primary market research by interviewing 5-10 condo building managers?
    -   What are their current biggest pain points with waste management?
    -   What is their current budget or cost for waste services?
    -   How do they perceive a premium, fee-based recycling service? What features (e.g., sustainability reports) are most appealing?
-   **Question:** Who are the direct and indirect competitors providing any form of recycling service to residential buildings in our target districts? Can we identify their service model and pricing?

#### 4. Operations & Technology

-   **Question:** What are the exact material specifications, quality requirements, and current purchasing prices for our target recyclable materials (PET, Paper, Cardboard, HDPE) from major processors like Wongpanit and SCG Packaging?
-   **Question:** Which specific CRM/logistics software platforms (e.g., Odoo, Zoho, a local alternative) offer the best combination of features, API accessibility, and cost-effectiveness for our operational model (route planning, client management, data tracking)?
-   **Question:** What is the most effective and culturally appropriate way to engage with and potentially partner with local "saleng" (informal collectors)? Should this be a formal partnership or an informal buy-per-kg arrangement?
