# Verification Plan — Assumptions and Unverified Items

## Purpose
Systematically replace assumptions with verified data and citations; track status to closure.

## Process
1. Triage weekly: prioritize High→Medium→Low.
2. Collect evidence (3 sources where feasible); save under `research/evidence/...`.
3. Update artifacts with citations; remove placeholders.
4. Re-run QA; append Integrity Log entry.
5. Close item when confidence ≥0.8 and citation(s) present.
