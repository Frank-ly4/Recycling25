# Legal Gap Analysis - Bangkok Condo Recycling Service

## Executive Summary
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of legal and regulatory gaps for the Bangkok Condo Recycling Service business plan. Based on a thorough review of existing documentation and applicable Thai regulations, we have identified 15 key gaps requiring attention before launch. These gaps are categorized by priority (High/Medium/Low) with recommended actions and timelines.

**Critical Findings:**

3. PDPA compliance framework needs implementation for resident data
4. Multiple contract templates contain unenforceable clauses under Thai law
5. No clear regulatory strategy for scaling beyond initial operation size

## Methodology
This gap analysis was conducted by:
1. Reviewing all documents in `preservation/necessary_documentation/` folder
2. Analyzing `legal/01_Legal_Checklist_Thailand.md`

4. Evaluating business plan components against legal requirements
5. Identifying missing documentation and compliance gaps
