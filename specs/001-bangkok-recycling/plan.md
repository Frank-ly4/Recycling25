# Bangkok Recycling Business Plan Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation approach for creating a comprehensive business plan for a tech-enabled recycling service targeting condominium buildings in Bangkok, Thailand.

## Implementation Strategy
We will use a component-based approach, with each agent focusing on their specialized domain:

1. **Strategy Analysis** (strategy_analyst)
   - Analyze market positioning and segmentation
   - Define value proposition and go-to-market strategy
   - Identify target customer segments

2. **Financial Modeling** (finance_modeler)
   - Create 36-month financial projections
   - Develop pricing catalog with multiple tiers
   - Document assumptions and sensitivity analysis

3. **Operations Planning** (operations_planner)
   - Design facility requirements and logistics
   - Create hiring plan with roles and timeline
   - Develop operations risk matrix

4. **Compliance Review** (compliance_reviewer)
   - Identify legal and regulatory requirements
   - Analyze existing documentation for gaps
   - Recommend compliance actions

5. **Quality Assurance** (qa_probe_agent)
   - Verify coverage across all components
   - Validate financial projections meet targets
   - Ensure Bangkok-specific context throughout

## Implementation Details

### Core Implementation
1. Run QA probe to assess current state
2. Generate strategy documents (strategy_analyst)
3. Create financial models and pricing (finance_modeler)
4. Develop operations plans (operations_planner)
5. Perform compliance review (compliance_reviewer)
6. Run final QA validation (qa_probe_agent)

### Technical Implementation
- All financial data will be in CSV format
- All documentation will be in Markdown
- All artifacts will follow BP_ naming convention
- All costs will be in THB (Thai Baht)

## Dependencies
- Strategy analysis must complete before financial modeling
- Financial models needed before operations planning
- All components must be complete before final QA validation

## Validation Criteria
- Financial models show path to 50,000+ THB monthly profit
- All pricing maintains minimum 10% margins
- Operations plans include Bangkok-specific costs and considerations
- All external data includes citations
- Coverage analysis shows >80% for all artifact types
