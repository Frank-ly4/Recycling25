Vision and strategy
Mission: We provide a turn-key, fee-based recycling service for mid-to-large Bangkok condominiums to comply with BMA source-separation policy, improve building cleanliness, and deliver auditable ESG impact. We solve for juristic managers who lack reliable, comprehensive recycling and reporting, and for residents who want a simple program that actually gets recycled. The urgency comes from BMA’s “No Mixed Waste” push (20 THB sorted vs 60 THB unsorted), tightening ESG expectations, and growing developer pressure to show waste diversion.

Value proposition: Outcomes clients get
- Compliance and risk reduction: Program design aligned to BMA policy; monthly ESG reports (kg by material, trends, CO2e avoided); chain-of-custody documentation.
- Operational relief: Weekly scheduled pickups, standardized bins/signage, overflow alerts, and incident response ≤ 24h; cleaner waste rooms and fewer pests.
- Reputation and resident satisfaction: Bilingual engagement materials, optional incentives; measurable improvements in participation and NPS.

Strategic scope (next 12 months)
- Geography: Bangkok Zone A pilot focusing on 2–3 adjacent districts (e.g., Sukhumvit, Sathorn, Phaya Thai) for route density.
- Customer segments: Condominiums of 300–600 units; secondary segments include office towers for future expansion after condo proof.
- Materials: PET (clear vs colored), HDPE, paper/cardboard (grades), metals (aluminum, steel), glass. Organics/e-waste via scheduled events, not routine service in year 1.

Differentiation (durable edge)
- Reliability and SLAs: ≥ 98% on-time pickups; documented SOPs; service credits for chronic misses.
- Compliance and data: Building-level ESG report monthly; KPI dashboard (diversion %, contamination %, on-time %, overflow rate %); PDPA-compliant data handling.
- Route density and cost discipline: Cluster-first footprint yields lower cost/ton and fewer overflows.
- Partner-positive ecosystem: Collaborate with saleng (last-meter assistance) and processors with spec adherence to upgrade bale pricing.

Success definition
- 12 months: 8–10 paying buildings; ≥ 25% diversion; ≤ 5% contamination; ≥ 98% on-time; ≤ 3% overflow; participation ≥ 30%; NPS ≥ +30; cost/ton ≤ 2,000 THB trending to ≤ 1,500 THB; publish 2 case studies.
- 36 months: 25–30 buildings (2–3 trucks), diversion ≥ 35%; contamination ≤ 4%; cost/ton ≤ 1,400 THB; participation ≥ 45%; NPS ≥ +40; EPR-ready and SE-certified; offtake MOUs ≥ 2 per key material.

Market and customer
ICP: Mid-to-large condominiums (300–600 units) within tight zones; pain points include BMA compliance, messy/overflowing waste rooms, unreliable ad-hoc recycling, lack of reporting. Decision makers: Juristic Person Manager and condo committee; influencers include building cleaners/security and developer/management company.

Demand proof: Validation sprint plan in docs/GoToMarket/01_Validation_Sprint.md targets 100 buildings, 10 meetings, 3–5 LOIs in 14 days. First pilots will be logged in pilots/bangkok-zone-a (LOIs, site audits, KPI baselines). Case studies to follow after conversion.

Pricing power: Anchors are (a) municipal baseline (20 vs 60 THB policy), (b) free alternatives (Waste Buy/saleng), and (c) condo internal sorter effort. We are price maker on compliance reporting, reliability, and end-to-end service (80–100 THB/unit/month for 300–600 unit buildings). For price-sensitive sites we can offer building lump-sum or reduced-fee + modest revenue share.

Adoption risks & mitigations
- “We already have saleng/junk buyer”: Position breadth (all recyclables), reliability, data/reporting, and cleanliness; offer optional revenue-share tier.
- “Residents won’t participate”: Floor-level bins, in-unit bags, bilingual signage, periodic engagement; report progress; optional incentives via partner.
- “Budget is tight”: Building-level lump sum with deposit; pilot to prove value; show BMA compliance ROI.

Offering and operations
Service catalog (productized)
- Weekly recyclable collection; bins/signage; monthly ESG reporting; overflow alerts; incident response; e-waste/organics “event days”.
- Bespoke: Floor-by-floor pickups (premium), resident incentive programs, multi-language concierge engagement.
- SLAs documented in docs/GoToMarket/05_Pilot_SLA.md and 06_Service_Agreement_12m.md.

Process readiness
- SOPs authored: ops/SOPs/01_Collection_SOP.md, 02_Sorting_SOP.md, 03_HS_Crisis_Comms.md.
- Field validation plan: Pilot phase requires arrival scans, bin photos, intake weight logs (timestamped) as evidence; KPI sampling cadence defined in pilots/bangkok-zone-a/kpis.md.

Capacity model
- Fleet: Start with 1 non-compacting box/cage truck (Isuzu FRR 210 or smaller N-series if access constraints). Fuel ~9.5–15k THB/mo with clustering.
- Staffing: 1 driver + 1 loader; shared sorting initially; add part-time sorter as volume increases.
- Processing: Sell to 2–3 vetted buyers; spec sheets/terms on file; bale to upgrade pricing.
- Buffers: Overflow procedures (alerts within 24h, interim bins), backup rental truck contact, preventive maintenance schedule.

Quality controls
- Contamination threshold ≤ 5% (intake sampling weekly); escalation: manager notice → refresher signage → onsite demo.
- Chain-of-custody: labeled bags by condo/date/material; intake logs; inventory; offtake receipts.
- Incident response: ≤ 24h acknowledgment; root-cause within 72h; crisis comms per SOP.

Legal and compliance (Thailand-focused)
Entity and permits
- Structure: Thai-majority Ltd for speed; parallel BOI application for 100% foreign control; pursue Social Enterprise certification (≥ 70% reinvestment).
- Permits: BMA District permit under Public Health Act (Business Detrimental to Health); DLT commercial vehicle registration/tax/inspection; no DIW factory license required if <50 hp and <50 employees; Social Security registration; see legal/01_Legal_Checklist_Thailand.md.
- PDPA readiness: Minimal data capture, purpose-limited; privacy policy and consent text (if using QR/app) maintained.

Contracting
- Pilot SLA terms in docs/GoToMarket/05_Pilot_SLA.md; 12-month contract in 06_Service_Agreement_12m.md with on-time SLA, insurance, PDPA, contamination, and fuel surcharge clauses.

Data protection
- Data flows in modules/tech/README.md; monthly ESG reports per docs/GoToMarket/07_ESG_Report_Template.md; retention and access per meta/standards.md; consent where applicable.

Reporting
- Monthly ESG to clients; internal KPI reviews weekly/monthly; regulatory submissions as required (e.g., BMA permit renewals, social security, tax filings) owned by Ops/Finance leads.

Finance and unit economics
Assumptions (finance/01_Assumptions_and_BreakEven.md)
- Monthly module cost: 150–160k THB (vehicle ~50k incl. maint/insur, fuel 10–15k, labor 45–70k, facility 20–30k, misc 5–10k).
- Revenue: 80–100 THB/unit/month; example 5×400×90 = 180k fees + 10–30k materials.

Breakeven & sensitivity
- Break-even ~4–6 large condos at 80–100 THB; comfortable zone 8–10. Primary downside: price undercut (–30%); mitigations include SLA/value focus and alternate pricing tiers. Fuel and PET swings secondary; fees-first model buffers participation variance.

Cash cycle
- Invoices monthly, Net-15; client deposits for bins; processor terms: aim for pickup-on-payment or ≤ Net-15; maintain operating buffer for AR.

Investment
- Seed need aligned to vehicle, facility deposit, bins/signage, working capital (approx. 0.7–1.1M THB depending on lease vs purchase). Tranche milestones: LOIs signed, BMA permit approved, first 5 paid contracts. Data room checklist at investors/Data_Room_Index.md.

Go-to-market
Channels
- Direct outreach to juristic managers and developer portfolios (primary). Partnerships: processors (referrals), NGOs for engagement, district offices for credibility. Tenders: monitor but not core initially.

Sales materials
- One-pager (03_OnePager.md), deck outline (04_Deck_Outline.md), kit index (02_Sales_Kit_Index.md) ready; customize branding and metrics as pilots run.

Pilot design
- Entry: LOI, site audit, bin plan, schedule. Success metrics: on-time ≥ 98%, contamination ≤ 5%, participation ≥ 25% within pilot, no chronic overflow, positive manager feedback. Exit: 12-month agreement per 06_Service_Agreement_12m.md.

Case studies
- After 2+ months paid service: 1-page per building with before/after KPIs, manager quotes, photos (stored under docs/GoToMarket/case-studies/).

Pilots and measurement
Pilot scope (bangkok-zone-a)
- 3–5 buildings (300–600 units) within cluster; weekly pickups; volume target 0.8–1.6 tons/month per 400-unit building; roles/owners per rollout-plan.md.

KPI schema
- Defined in pilots/bangkok-zone-a/kpis.md with formulas, sources, cadence, and owners for diversion %, contamination %, cost/ton, on-time %, overflow %, participation %, CO2e, NPS.

Instrumentation
- Arrival scans/time stamps, bin photos, portable scales (material and total weights), simple app or Google Form for logs; weekly QC sampling; monthly compiled ESG report using docs/GoToMarket/07_ESG_Report_Template.md.

Learning loop
- Weekly KPI review; lessons appended to pilots/bangkok-zone-a/lessons.md and meta/discoveries.md; SOPs tuned as needed; issues logged in meta/issues.md with severity and next step.

ESG and impact
Impact thesis
- Environmental: Diversion of recyclables from landfill/leakage, reduced contamination, CO2e avoided via material recycling.
- Social: Formal jobs with fair wages/PPE/training; collaboration rather than displacement of informal collectors; community education.

Standards alignment
- SDGs (11, 12, 14). Consider GRI waste disclosures and ISSB/SASB (Waste Management) indicators as scale increases. Reporting via monthly ESG template (07_ESG_Report_Template.md) and quarterly roll-ups.

CO2e factors
- Stub in config/co2e_factors.json; replace with Thai or regional LCA factors (e.g., DEQP/TGO sources). Validation by cross-checking with processor disclosures and literature; document factor source/version in config.

Tech and data
System architecture
- Capture: Driver scans arrival → logs per-material weights → uploads bin photos → marks departure.
- Persist: Append-only logs stored in project data store (initially spreadsheets); monthly aggregation to ESG reports; backups retained per standards.
- Privacy: No resident PII by default; any QR/opt-in data handled under PDPA with consent and minimal retention.

Identifiers and standards
- Condo IDs, material codes, kg/tons, ISO 8601 timestamps, as in meta/standards.md. No known violations in current docs.

Automations
- Near-term: Route clustering via spreadsheet/Google Maps; report generation scripts; offtake invoice match. Mid-term: basic dashboard for KPIs; OR-Tools evaluation for VRP.

Access control
- Role-based: Ops (logs), Materials (QC/inventory), Finance (invoices/costs), Tech (report scripts), Leadership (all). Git history for doc changes; maintain access list outside repo for client data.

Team and governance
Stakeholders & RACI
- Juristic manager (C), Condo committee (A), Ops Lead (R), Materials Lead (R), Community Lead (R), Finance Lead (R), Tech Lead (R), Founder/CEO (A). Full list in meta/stakeholders.md.

Cadence
- Daily route readiness; weekly KPI review and issue triage; monthly ESG reports per building; quarterly investor updates. Close-session checklist in meta/tasks.md.

Decision logs
- ADR-0001 adopted meta system, fees-first, Thai-majority now + BOI parallel, SE pursuit. ADR-0002 (legal path specifics) to be completed post-counsel calls; open decisions: SE naming/timing; BOI activity category mapping; initial vehicle lease vs purchase.

Risks and assumptions
Top risks (likelihood × impact)
1) Price undercut by competitors → Defend with SLA/compliance/data; lock clusters; early warnings: lost bids to price-only offers.
2) Slow participation pickup → Engagement plan, floor bins, in-unit bags; monitor participation % trend.
3) Processor price volatility → Fees-first model; offtake MOUs; bale quality improvements.
4) Legal/regulatory delays (permits/BOI) → Start with Thai-majority; parallel BOI; buffer timelines; track permit SLAs.
5) Labor turnover → Fair pay/PPE/training; career path; small bench.

Unknowns
- BMA District permit specifics by target district; processor terms and specs; insurance quotes; warehouse availability; captured in research/PENDING_RESEARCH.md with owners/due dates.

Dependencies
- Processors capacity/prices; developer partnerships; district endorsement; insurance coverage; vehicle availability.

Local context and ethics
Community engagement & safeguards
- Integrate (not displace) informal collectors via collaboration and hiring pipeline; fair labor standards, PPE, training; transparent chain-of-custody to avoid greenwashing.

Language and culture
- Bilingual (TH/EN) materials; field training to building cleaners/security; culturally appropriate signage and messaging; manager presentations in Thai with English materials as needed.

Geography/logistics
- Consider monsoon season impacts on access and material condition (paper); schedule around Bangkok traffic peaks; cluster near BTS/MRT corridors for efficiency.
