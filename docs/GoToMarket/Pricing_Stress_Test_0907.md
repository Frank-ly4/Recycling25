# Pricing Stress Test Results — Bangkok Condo Recycling

Date: 2025-09-07
Model: claude-4-opus stress testing

## Base Case Summary (from Pricing_Tiers_Results_0907.md)
- Module cost: 150-160k THB/month
- Service tiers (100% of units billed):
  - 25% tier: 75 THB, 6 buildings (2,400 units) = 180k revenue
  - 50% tier: 90 THB, 5 buildings (2,000 units) = 180k revenue  
  - 75% tier: 100 THB, 4 buildings (1,600 units) = 160k revenue
  - 100% tier: 110 THB, 4 buildings (1,600 units) = 176k revenue

## Stress Factors Tested
1. Competitor undercut: -30% pricing pressure
2. Diesel increase: +20% (affects ~10-15k fuel budget)
3. Labor increase: +10% (affects ~45-55k labor budget)
4. Facility increase: +15% (affects ~36-44k facility budget)
5. Volume overage: +10% above tier (triggers costs, potential upgrades)
6. Combined worst: All factors simultaneously

| | Combined worst | 5 | OK |
| **100% Tier @110 THB** |
| | Base case | 4 | Best |
| | Competitor -30% | 6 | Challenging |
| | Combined worst | 4 | Resilient |

## Go/No-Go Decision Matrix by Access Tier

### Tier A (Easy Access - ground level, wide docks)
- **GO**: 50% tier @85-90 THB with 5+ buildings
- **CAUTION**: 25% tier only with 7+ building commitment
- **NO-GO**: Any tier if local competitor <70 THB

### Tier B (Moderate Access - some constraints)
- **GO**: 50% tier @90-95 THB with 5 buildings OR 75% tier @100 THB with 4 buildings
- **CAUTION**: 25% tier regardless of building count
- **NO-GO**: If combined stresses present without 6+ buildings

### Tier C (Difficult Access - tight spaces, time windows)
- **GO**: 75% tier @100-105 THB OR 100% tier @110-120 THB with 4 buildings
- **CAUTION**: 50% tier even with surcharges
- **NO-GO**: 25% tier (access delays compound losses)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Competitor Defense
1. Lock in 12-month contracts with 3-month price protection
2. Build switching costs: branded bins, resident relationships, integrated reporting
3. Bundle services: add e-waste days, special collections
4. Focus on compliance value vs price alone

### Cost Hedges
1. Fuel surcharge: Auto-trigger at diesel >38 THB/L (+2 THB/unit per +5 THB/L increase)
2. Annual price escalator: 3-5% built into contracts
3. Efficiency KPIs: Route density, contamination rates, participation lift
4. Volume caps: Clear tier thresholds with auto-upgrade rules

### Operational Buffers
1. Start with 6 buildings at 50% tier (20% margin buffer)
2. Stagger contract starts to smooth cash flow
3. Maintain 1-month working capital reserve
4. Diversify building types within access tier

## Recommendations

### Primary Strategy
- **Target**: 50% tier @90 THB/unit
- **Minimum cluster**: 5 buildings initially, scale to 6-7 for resilience
- **Geography**: Single micro-cluster with Tier A/B access mix
- **Contract**: 12-month terms with quarterly reviews

### Tier Positioning
1. **25% tier**: Only offer with 7+ building pre-commitment or @85 THB
2. **50% tier**: Default offering, proven resilient to single stresses
3. **75% tier**: Premium option for high-participation buildings
4. **100% tier**: Ultra-premium for full-service commitments

### Financial Guardrails
- Never price below 75 THB regardless of tier
- Require 40% deposit for 25% tier subscriptions
- Monthly billing in advance
- Service pause clause if 2 months unpaid

## Conclusion
The 50% service tier at 90 THB/unit with 5-6 buildings provides optimal balance of:
- Market acceptability (below 100 THB psychological barrier)
- Operational efficiency (moderate volume = predictable routes)
- Financial resilience (survives all single stress factors)
- Growth potential (clear upgrade path to higher tiers)

This forms the foundation for sustainable Bangkok market entry.
