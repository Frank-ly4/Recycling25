## Objectives
- Prove reliability, compliance, and resident experience across 2–3 adjacent buildings.
- Generate case studies and references; prepare for portfolio rollout.

- Contamination rate ≤ 10% by weight for top fractions.
- Resident complaint rate trending down; case study-ready evidence.

## Exclusivity (Micro-Cluster)
- Limited, performance-based exclusivity within the micro-cluster during pilot and for 6 months after conversion, provided:
  - On-time ≥ 98% (monthly);
  - Reporting delivered on schedule; and
