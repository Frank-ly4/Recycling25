## Recycling Service for Bangkok Condominiums — One Pager

What we do
- Turn-key recycling service for 300–600 unit condos: weekly pickup, bins/signage, resident engagement, and monthly ESG reporting.

Why it matters (ROI)
- Compliance: Aligns with BMA “No Mixed Waste” policy (20 THB vs 60 THB unsorted).
- Cleanliness: Organized bin rooms, fewer overflows, fewer pests.
- Brand: Measurable impact for committees, residents, and developers.

How it works
- Setup: Site audit, bin placement, signage (TH/EN), in-unit bags optional.
- Service: Scheduled weekly pickup by uniformed crew; non-compacting truck; chain-of-custody.
- Reporting: Monthly report (kg by material, trend, CO2e avoided).

Pricing (building-level fee)
- Standard: 80–100 THB per unit per month (300–600 unit buildings).
- Alternatives: Lump-sum per building; limited revenue share for price-sensitive sites.

Pilot offer (30–60 days)
- Free or reduced fee pilot; clear SLA; convert to 12-month agreement after success.

What you receive monthly
- Pickup logs, ESG report, improvement tips, dedicated manager.
