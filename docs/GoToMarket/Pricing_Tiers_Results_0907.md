# Pricing Tiers Results — 100% Billed, 25% Service Tier (Bangkok)

## Assumptions (from plan)
- Units/building: 400
- Buildings/cluster (example): 5 (2,000 units billed)
- Monthly module cost: 150–160k THB (vehicle 50k, fuel 10–15k, labor 45–55k, facility 36–44k, misc 5–10k)
- Price bands: 80 / 90 / 100 THB per unit (access tiers A=80–90, B=90–100, C=100–120)
- Service tier: 25% included volume/engagement, with auto-upgrade if exceeded
- Package/blocks: 100-unit blocks; micro-cluster minimum ≥300 units across ≥2 buildings
- Fuel surcharge: trigger if diesel >38 THB/L for 30 days (+2 THB/unit per +5 THB/L)
- Materials revenue: bonus only (via MOUs); not used for base viability
## Consumption Estimate Reality Check
- At 25% tier (100 units) and 100kg/month baseline: ~1.3 bottles/unit/day (assuming 25g/bottle), which underestimates true usage (~2–4 bottles/day).
- Realistic monthly volumes per 25% tier building: 200–300kg; scale tiers to:
  - 25% tier: ~200kg/month
  - 50% tier: ~400kg/month
  - 75% tier: ~600kg/month
  - 100% tier: ~800kg/month
- Use these adjusted volumes for setting auto-upgrade thresholds and capacity planning.

## Service Tiers Explained
- 25% tier: Included volume/engagement for 25% of units (e.g., 100 kg/month for 400-unit building)
- 50% tier: Included volume/engagement for 50% of units (e.g., 200 kg/month for 400-unit building)
- 75% tier: Included volume/engagement for 75% of units (e.g., 300 kg/month for 400-unit building)
- 100% tier: Full service volume/engagement for 100% of units (e.g., 400 kg/month for 400-unit building)

## Revenues (building-paid across 100% units)
- 5×400 units = 2,000 billed units
- Revenue @80: 160,000 THB/month
- Revenue @90: 180,000 THB/month
- Revenue @100: 200,000 THB/month

## Realistic Bangkok Pricing by Service Tier (100% billed)
Considering labor costs, fuel, competition, and willingness-to-pay:

| Service Tier | Realistic Price/Unit | Service Scope | Monthly Revenue (400-unit building) |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| 25% tier | 70-80 THB | Basic weekly pickup, minimal volume | 28,000-32,000 THB |
| 50% tier | 85-95 THB | Standard weekly pickup, moderate volume | 34,000-38,000 THB |
| 75% tier | 95-105 THB | Enhanced weekly pickup, high volume | 38,000-42,000 THB |
| 100% tier | 105-120 THB | Full service, max volume, priority | 42,000-48,000 THB |

## Buildings Needed to Break-Even (150-160k THB module cost)

| Service Tier | Price Used | Buildings Needed | Total Units Billed | Monthly Revenue |
|--------------|------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 25% tier | 75 THB | 5.3-5.7 → 6 buildings | 2,400 units | 180,000 THB |
| 50% tier | 90 THB | 4.4-4.7 → 5 buildings | 2,000 units | 180,000 THB |
| 75% tier | 100 THB | 3.8-4.0 → 4 buildings | 1,600 units | 160,000 THB |
| 100% tier | 110 THB | 3.4-3.6 → 4 buildings | 1,600 units | 176,000 THB |

## Key Insights
1. **25% tier**: Requires 6 buildings at 75 THB to break even (challenging)
2. **50% tier**: Sweet spot - 5 buildings at 90 THB covers module comfortably
3. **75% tier**: 4 buildings at 100 THB works if access is good
4. **100% tier**: Premium pricing (110+ THB) justified by full service; 4 buildings sufficient

## Recommendation for Bangkok Launch
- Target 50% tier as baseline: 90 THB/unit, need 5 buildings
- Offer 25% tier only with 6+ building commitment or surcharges
- Position 75-100% tiers as premium options for buildings wanting comprehensive service
- All tiers bill 100% of units; tier determines included service volume

## Access tier guidance (100% billed; 25% service tier)
- Tier A (easy access): Prefer 80–90 THB; target ≥5 buildings for headroom
- Tier B (moderate): Prefer 90–100 THB; 5 buildings recommended
- Tier C (tight docks/time windows): 100–120 THB; ≥4 buildings feasible at 100–110 THB

## Package/blocks and upgrades
- Sell in 100-unit blocks with micro-cluster minimum (≥300 units across ≥2 buildings)
- If included kg/month exceeded for a building, auto-upgrade 1 block next cycle; emergency overage pickups billed per schedule

## Recommendations (25% service tier baseline)
- Pricing floors: A=80, B=90, C=100 THB/unit
- Minimum cluster: 5 buildings of ~400 units; or 2,000 billed units equivalent
- Use fuel surcharge rule; keep materials out of base; secure ≥2 processor MOUs
