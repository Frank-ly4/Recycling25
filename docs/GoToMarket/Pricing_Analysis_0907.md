# Pricing Reasonableness — Bangkok Condo Recycling (80–100 THB/unit/month)

## Summary Verdict
- Reasonable with guardrails if: single micro‑cluster, weekly pickup, clear scope limits, and minimum building size (≥300 units).
- High sensitivity to: competitor undercut (≤‑30%), participation variance, access delays.

## Guardrails
- Scope: Weekly pickup; defined streams; max 2 special pickups/month; contamination thresholds.
- Price bands: 80 (base), 90 (standard), 100 (premium/access constrained). Surcharges for extra trips, bulky, or special handling.
- Floors: Do not discount below 80 without offset (reduced scope or prepayment/term).

## Fluctuation Protections
- Materials volatility: Do not include materials revenue in base price; treat as bonus with ≥2 processor MOUs and 60–90 day floors.
- Fuel: Fuel surcharge trigger if diesel >38 THB/L sustained for 30 days; +2 THB/unit/month per +5 THB/L.
- Participation: Building pays by unit count (not participation); include engagement package as optional add‑on.

## Unit Economics Check (Indicative)
- Costs per “module” (clustered 4–6 condos):
  - Vehicle lease/finance: ~50k THB/month
  - Fuel: 10–15k THB/month (clustered)
  - Labor (driver+loader): 36–43k base + SSO/OT buffer → 45–55k
  - Facility (200 m² @ 180–220 THB/m²): 36–44k
  - Misc/insurance/PPE/consumables: 5–10k
  - Total: ~150–160k THB/month
- Revenue example (5×400 units @ 90 THB): 180k fees (+ bonus materials)

## Pricing Fit by Access Tier
- Tier A (easy access): 80–90 THB
- Tier B (moderate constraints): 90–100 THB
- Tier C (tight docks/time windows): 100–120 THB (requires scope addendum)

## Package/Block Pricing (Add-on to Building Fee)
- Blocks of units: buildings can subscribe in blocks (e.g., 100-unit blocks) with a minimum baseline (e.g., 300 units across ≥2 buildings in the micro‑cluster).
- Per‑block rate: priced within 80–100 THB band depending on access tier; smaller blocks use the higher end of band.
- Volume triggers: if actual collected volume exceeds the included threshold (e.g., kg/month per block), auto‑upgrade to the next block tier for the following billing cycle; emergency overage pickup billed at schedule rate.
- Safeguards: minimum subscription term (3 months), upgrade/downgrade rules defined; extra collections or special materials priced via add‑ons.

## Participation Tiers (Subscription baseline)
- Define tiers by % of units participating: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%.
- Building fee remains building-wide, but service scope and engagement scale with tier; packages can be sold in unit blocks with minimum baseline across buildings.
- Use 25% tier as conservative baseline for feasibility checks; pricing must cover fixed costs via cluster density.

### Break-even framing (indicative)
- Module fixed+semi-fixed ~150–160k THB/month.
- Example cluster: 5 buildings × 400 units = 2,000 units physical; at 25% tier → 500 “active equivalents.”
- At 90 THB/unit baseline applied to all units (building-paid): 2,000 × 90 = 180k THB → covers module.
- If priced per “active equivalents” only: 500 × 90 = 45k THB → insufficient; require either building-wide fee or higher per-active price with minimums.
- Conclusion: Prefer building-paid model with participation-agnostic pricing; add engagement add-ons to lift actual recovery.

## Go/No‑Go Heuristics
- Go: ≥3 buildings in one micro‑cluster; route time ≤8 hrs/route; access surveys pass with N‑Series.
- No‑Go: Two or more buildings requiring FRR or spread across non‑adjacent districts.

## Next
- Validate with 15–20 manager interviews; finalize guardrails one‑pager; add SLA/KPI appendix.
