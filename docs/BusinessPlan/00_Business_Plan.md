## Business Plan — Bangkok Condo Recycling Service

### 1. Executive summary
- Concept: Turn-key, fee-based recycling service for Bangkok condominiums. Fees are primary revenue; material sales are bonus. Compliance and reporting are core value.
- Targets: Break-even at ~4–6 large condos (~400 units) at 80–100 THB/unit/month; comfortable at 8–10. Cluster routes in 2–3 adjacent districts.
- Legal: Thai-majority Ltd now; BOI promotion in parallel; Social Enterprise certification for investor tax advantages. BMA permit (Public Health Act), DLT vehicle registration; no DIW factory license if <50 hp & <50 employees.
- Ask: Tranche-based seed to execute 60–90 day pilot (vehicle, bins, facility deposit, working capital).

### 2. Problem and market
- BMA “No Mixed Waste” fee structure (20 vs 60 THB) creates compliance incentive; condos need a reliable solution with minimal staff burden.
- Informal sector and free programs exist but are unreliable/limited scope; professional turn-key service plus reporting fills the gap.

### 3. Solution and differentiation
- Weekly pickup, bins/signage, resident engagement, monthly ESG report; optional e-waste days. SLA-backed reliability, data transparency, compliance documentation.
- Zone clustering, SOPs, and simple tech (route optimization, data capture) to keep unit economics efficient.

### 4. Business model and pricing
- Primary revenue: building-level fee 80–100 THB/unit/month (300–600 unit condos). Alternative: lump-sum per building or reduced-fee + limited revenue share.
- Bonus revenue: materials sale (baled PET/HDPE/paper); future EPR/plastic credits; corporate sponsorships.

### 5. Operations
- Vehicle: non-compacting box/cage truck (Isuzu FRR 210 or smaller N-series if access constraints). Fuel ~9.5–15k THB/mo with tight clustering.
- Facility: 150–300 m² compliant warehouse; manual/semi-automated sorting; baler when volume warrants. SOPs for H&S, contamination control, and chain-of-custody.
- Staffing: driver + loader; shared sorting early; training, PPE, performance incentives; small bench.

### 6. Legal and compliance
- Thai-majority Ltd immediately; BOI application in parallel; Social Enterprise certification (≥70% reinvestment) to enable 100% investor tax deduction.
- BMA District “Business Detrimental to Health” permit; PDPA data/privacy policy; DLT vehicle registration/insurance; Social Security registration.

### 7. Go-to-market
- ICP: 300–600 unit condos in Sukhumvit/Sathorn/Phaya Thai. 30–60 day pilot → 12-month contract. Case studies and referrals to scale clusters.
- Sales kit: one-pager, bilingual deck, sample ESG report, pilot SLA, 12-month service agreement.

### 8. Financials (assumptions to validate)
- Monthly module cost: 150–160k THB (vehicle 50k, fuel 10–15k, labor 45–70k, facility 20–30k, misc 5–10k).
- Revenue example: 5×400 units×90 THB ≈ 180k fees + 10–30k materials = 190–210k THB.
- Sensitivities: competitor undercut (–30%) is primary risk; fuel and PET swings secondary; building-level fees buffer participation variance.

### 9. Risks and mitigations
- Undercut: SLA, compliance ROI vs BMA fee, referrals. Processor terms: spec sheets and MOUs; baling for premiums.
- Participation: in-unit bags/floor bins, education, incentives, feedback; optional Trash Lucky integration.
- Cash flow: deposits, Net-15, tranche funding; lean capex.
- PR/compliance: crisis comms, insurance, PDPA, documented chain-of-custody.

### 10. Roadmap
- 14-day validation sprint (outreach, LOIs, specs/quotes, legal scoping).
- 60–90 day pilot (3–5 buildings), convert to 12-month contracts; publish case studies.
- Tranche-based investor raise for vehicle/facility and working capital; scale clusters to 8–10 buildings; then 15–20.
