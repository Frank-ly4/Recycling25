## Porter's Five Forces — Bangkok Condo Recycling Service (2025-10-27)

### 1) Threat of New Entrants — Moderate to High
- Barriers: moderate capex (vehicle, facility), BMA permit and compliance, relationships with juristic managers, route density know-how.
- Drivers of entry: low tech, replicable model, bundlers (FM companies) can extend into recycling.
- Mitigations (moat-builders):
  - Developer/RE partnerships (e.g., framework agreements, co-branded programs).
  - Multi-year SLAs with performance credits (not guarantees) and case-study promotion rights.
  - Route clustering in targeted districts to lower unit costs and raise density barriers.
  - Evidence-led ESG reporting and auditability that informal/low-cost entrants struggle to match.

### 2) Bargaining Power of Buyers (Condo Juristic/Developers) — High
- Dynamics: price sensitivity; budgets vary by building size/quality; FM bundlers offer one-bill alternatives.
- Mitigations:
  - Tiered packages tied to measurable outcomes (compliance vs. premium engagement).
  - ROI narrative vs. BMA fees, plus compliance risk mitigation and insurance coverage.
  - Performance credits and clear inclusions/exclusions to control scope creep.
  - Switching costs via onboarding assets, signage, resident materials, and data integrations.

### 3) Bargaining Power of Suppliers — Moderate to High (by category)
- Vehicles: local used light trucks (e.g., Isuzu ELF 190) vs. imports; mitigate with multi-quote sourcing, preventative maintenance, and vendor relationships.
- Labor: tight urban labor markets; mitigate with above-market comp, training, safety, advancement paths.
- Processors: price floors and contamination specs; mitigate with multi-processor MOUs and quality controls (baling when viable).
- Fuel and facility: volatility and availability; mitigate with route optimization, clustering, and flexible leases.

### 4) Threat of Substitutes — High
- Substitutes: informal collectors (saleng), do-nothing status quo, government basic collection, janitorial DIY sorting.
- Mitigations:
  - Integrate informal collectors (employment/subcontracting, guaranteed buy-back for clean fractions).
  - Differentiate on reliability, documentation, compliance alignment, and ESG data residents can see.
  - Resident engagement incentives (events, milestones, giveaways) to create social value.
  - Offer broader scope (e-waste days, contamination management) beyond high-value materials.

### 5) Industry Rivalry — Low now, likely rising
- Current: few specialized condo-focused recyclers; rivalry mostly with FM bundles or informal sector.
- Forward: FM entrants and copycats likely once the model is proven.
- Mitigations:
  - Cost advantage via dense routing; operational discipline; SOP-led quality.
  - Brand and trust via developer/association partnerships and audited reporting.
  - Selective exclusivity (by cluster/building groups) and referrals/case studies.

Overall intensity: currently moderate; defensibility hinges on execution speed, partnerships, compliance-grade service, and route density.
