# Strategy Summary - Bangkok Condo Recycling Service

## TL;DR
Tech-enabled recycling service for Bangkok condominiums that generates steady revenue through building-level fees (80-100 THB/unit/month), provides reliable collection, compliance documentation, and ESG reporting, while maintaining 50,000+ THB monthly profit through efficient operations and route density.

## Value Proposition
Our service solves three critical pain points for Bangkok condominiums:

1. **Compliance**: We align with BMA "No Mixed Waste" policy (20 THB vs 60 THB unsorted rate), providing documentation and reports that demonstrate regulatory compliance.

2. **Operational Simplicity**: We deliver a turn-key solution with scheduled weekly pickups, proper bins/signage, and trained staff, eliminating the management burden for condo juristic offices.

3. **Brand Enhancement**: We provide monthly ESG reports with environmental impact metrics (kg diverted, CO2e avoided) that condos can use in marketing materials and resident communications.
