Comprehensive Due Diligence Questions for Angel Investment in a Bangkok-Based Condominium Plastic Bottle Recycling Startup

Introduction

I'm considering investing $1–2 million in a Bangkok-based recycling startup focused on collecting plastic water bottles from condominium buildings presents both significant opportunities and complex risks. Thailand’s plastic waste crisis is acute, with the country ranking among the world’s top contributors to ocean plastic pollution. The government, private sector, and civil society are mobilizing to address this challenge, and the recycling sector is evolving rapidly in response to regulatory, technological, and market shifts. However, the sector’s complexity—spanning informal labor, regulatory hurdles, fluctuating commodity prices, and evolving consumer behavior—demands rigorous due diligence.

This here provides a robust, categorized list of due diligence questions that I would like answered before committing capital. Please answer only using information from your documents/plan so far.  If there's anything outstanding, please update the document to reflect further research/clarification/math/etc. is needed. The questions are organized under clear headings, each reflecting a critical area of business viability and investment risk. Each section is informed by current market data, regulatory frameworks, operational realities, and best practices in both Thai and international recycling sectors.

Market Opportunity
What is the total addressable market (TAM) for plastic bottle collection from condominiums in Bangkok, and how is it segmented by building type, size, and location?
[[ANSWER: MO-01]]
Status: ASSUMPTION_VALIDATE
Summary: The internal pack currently provides a **Zone A SOM** sizing and an ICP definition rather than a fully evidenced Bangkok-wide TAM segmentation. Zone A pilot districts total ~122,000 units across ~300 large condos (>300 units), implying ~11.0M THB/month addressable service-fee opportunity at the modeled fee levels (see `market_analysis.md`).

What are the current collection and recycling rates for plastic bottles in Bangkok’s residential sector, and how do these compare to national averages?
[[ANSWER: MO-04]]
Status: BENCHMARK_EXTERNAL
Summary: Benchmark sources have been added to the data room. A city-level benchmark from the Circulate Initiative report estimates that **~15% (≈134 kt/year) of plastic waste in Bangkok is recycled**, with the informal sector playing a dominant role (see `evidence/market/20251215_circulate_th_selected_cities_plastic_recycling_supply_chains.pdf`, p.16). For a national benchmark, the US-ASEAN report states Thailand generates **~2 million metric tons of plastic waste annually** and **~25% is recycled** (see `evidence/market/20251215_usasean_plastics_biannual_report_2023.pdf`, p.30).
Evidence (internal): market_analysis.md; executive_summary.md; outreach_kit/pitch_deck.md; audits/viability_check.md; evidence/bma/20251214_bma_greener_waste_fee_20_60.html; evidence/market/20251215_circulate_th_selected_cities_plastic_recycling_supply_chains.pdf; evidence/market/20251215_usasean_plastics_biannual_report_2023.pdf

[[/ANSWER]]






Analysis: Bangkok’s condominium sector is a major generator of plastic waste, with over 600,000 units and a growing urban population. The city’s new waste separation regulations and financial incentives for source separation are creating a more favorable environment for organized recycling businesses. However, the market remains fragmented, with significant competition from informal collectors (“saleng”) and established recycling firms. Understanding the precise size and accessibility of the target market is essential for assessing scalability and revenue potential.

Analysis: Successful recycling startups in Thailand often blend multiple revenue streams, including material sales, service contracts, and impact monetization (e.g., through plastic credits or ESG partnerships). The volatility of PET prices and the need for long-term, stable contracts with condominiums are critical considerations. Innovative models—such as gamified recycling, smart bins, and data-driven ESG reporting—are emerging and can differentiate the business.

Unit Economics and Financial Metrics
What are the key unit economics for the business (e.g., cost per kilogram collected, revenue per kilogram, gross margin per collection route)?
[[ANSWER: UE-01]]
Status: SOURCED_INTERNAL
Summary: Core unit economics are modeled on a **per-unit service fee** basis (not per-kg commodity trading). Key drivers include service fee (90 THB/unit/month), variable cost (30 THB/unit/month), and clustered fixed-cost structure (see `financials/model_inputs.json`, `financials/model_spec.md`).

Analysis: Thailand’s regulatory environment for recycling is complex and evolving. The Foreign Business Act, environmental regulations, and local BMA ordinances all impose significant compliance requirements. BOI promotion can offer substantial incentives but requires strict adherence to eligibility criteria. Regulatory risk is a major factor for foreign investors and must be carefully managed.

Board of Investment (BOI) Incentives and Foreign Ownership

How does BOI promotion affect the business’s competitive position relative to non-BOI competitors?
[[ANSWER: BOI-06]]
Status: BENCHMARK_EXTERNAL
Summary: Benchmark: BOI can improve competitiveness through tax/non-tax incentives (e.g., tax holidays, facilitation of foreign hiring), but compliance burden increases.
Evidence (internal): legal_compliance.md; evidence/boi/20251215_boi_a_guide_2023_en.pdf; evidence/boi/20251215_SEARCH_LOG.md
Gaps/Next: Model BOI vs non-BOI economics (tax savings vs compliance/admin costs) and decide before fundraising.
See: INVESTOR_QA_151225.md (BOI-06)
[[/ANSWER]]






What is the process for renewing or expanding BOI incentives as the business grows?
[[ANSWER: BOI-07]]
Status: BENCHMARK_EXTERNAL
Summary: Benchmark: BOI incentives/privileges may be expanded or amended with BOI approval as projects scale; process depends on activity and changes requested.
Evidence (internal): legal_compliance.md; evidence/boi/20251215_boi_a_guide_2023_en.pdf; evidence/boi/20251215_SEARCH_LOG.md
Gaps/Next: If BOI pursued, document the amendment/expansion pathway and trigger milestones (new facility, equipment, capacity).
See: INVESTOR_QA_151225.md (BOI-07)
[[/ANSWER]]






Analysis: BOI promotion is a powerful tool for foreign investors, offering tax breaks, ownership rights, and operational flexibility. However, compliance is rigorous, and failure to meet BOI requirements can result in loss of privileges. Investors should verify the status and sustainability of BOI incentives.
