# Evidence Folder (Sources)

## Purpose
`business_plan_rebuild/` is intended to be shared as a standalone investor data room. The `evidence/` folder stores **source documents** (PDFs, screenshots, archived pages) that back material claims in the plan.

## How to Use
Each evidence item should be referenced from `evidence_register.json` with:
- `source_url`
- `local_path`
- `excerpt`
- `retrieved_at`

## Naming Convention
- `YYYYMMDD_source_topic_shorttitle.pdf`
- `YYYYMMDD_source_topic_shorttitle.png`
- `YYYYMMDD_source_topic_shorttitle.md` (for extracted text/notes)
