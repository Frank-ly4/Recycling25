# Option Pool Policy Benchmarks & Research

**Document Date:** 2025-12-30  
**Prepared by:** Finance Lead / Governance  
**Purpose:** Evidence artifact documenting market benchmarks for option pool sizing and equity compensation structure

## 1. Executive Summary

Based on seed-stage startup benchmarks in Southeast Asia and globally, Recycling25 has adopted a **12% post-money option pool**, which falls within the standard 10-15% range for companies at this stage.

## 2. Pool Size Benchmarks

### 2.1 Industry Standards
| Source | Recommended Pool Size | Stage | Geography | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Y Combinator** | 10-15% | Seed / Post-YC | Global | Standard advice for YC companies at Demo Day |
| **500 Startups** | 10-15% | Seed | SE Asia / Global | Typical for 500 portfolio companies |
| **FirstRound Capital** | 10-20% | Seed to Series A | US | Higher range if pre-revenue and significant hiring needed |
| **Carta Equity Report 2023** | Median 13.5% | Seed | US | Median from >10k companies |
| **Index Ventures** | 10-12% | Seed | Europe | Conservative range; refresh at Series A |

**Our decision:** 12% aligns with median seed-stage practice and provides competitive hiring capacity for ~8-12 key hires over 18-24 months.

### 2.2 Post-Money vs Pre-Money Treatment
- **Market consensus:** Post-money treatment is now standard (investor bears proportional dilution cost)
- **Rationale:** Avoids founder dilution surprise; investors expect this structure post-2018
- **Our choice:** Post-money (12% comes from post-investment pie)

## 3. Vesting Schedule Benchmarks

### 3.1 Standard Vesting
| Parameter | Market Standard | Our Policy |
|---|---|---|
| **Duration** | 4 years | 4 years |
| **Cliff** | 1 year | 1 year |
| **Cadence** | Monthly after cliff | Monthly (1/48th per month after month 12) |
| **Acceleration** | Single or double trigger | Single-trigger 50% on exit; double-trigger for founders |

**Source:** Standard across US, Europe, SE Asia venture-backed companies. Codified in NVCA model docs, SAFE agreements, and regional VC term sheet templates.

### 3.2 Exercise Window
| Parameter | Conservative | Market Standard | Progressive | Our Policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Post-termination window** | 30 days | 90 days | 7-10 years | 90 days (with board discretion to extend) |

**Rationale:** 90 days is most common; avoids forcing immediate exercise decisions that may have tax consequences.

## 4. Grant Band Benchmarks

### 4.1 Role-Based Equity Ranges
Based on Carta, AngelList, and Holloway Equity Compensation Guide benchmarks for **seed-stage companies in logistics/operations-heavy sectors**:

| Role | Carta Median (Seed) | Our Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Late co-founder** | 1.5% - 5% | 1.0% - 3.0% | Lower end (already post-seed fundraise planning) |
| **VP / Head of Function** | 0.5% - 1.5% | 0.5% - 1.5% | Aligned |
| **Senior / Lead** | 0.25% - 1.0% | 0.25% - 1.0% | Aligned |
| **Mid-level** | 0.1% - 0.3% | 0.1% - 0.25% | Slightly conservative |
| **Junior / IC** | 0.01% - 0.1% | 0.05% - 0.1% | High-value ICs only |

**Thailand context:** Limited local data; extrapolated from Singapore/Vietnam seed-stage norms (similar cost of living and equity compensation maturity).

## 5. Refresh Policy Benchmarks

### 5.1 Trigger Points
- **Common trigger 1:** Pool <5% unallocated (prevents running out mid-hiring cycle)
- **Common trigger 2:** Series A or later funding rounds (refresh to 10-15% post-money)
- **Our policy:** Both triggers adopted; board discretion for ad-hoc refreshes if strategic hire requires it

### 5.2 Refresh Sizing
- **Market practice:** Return to 10-12% post-money at each major round
- **Our approach:** Will reassess at Series A based on hiring plan; no automatic refresh commitment

## 6. Tax & Legal Considerations (Thailand-Specific)

### 6.1 Thai Tax Treatment
- **Employee side:** Option grants are taxable as employment income upon exercise (difference between strike price and FMV)
- **Company side:** No employer tax deduction for equity grants in Thailand (vs cash compensation)
- **Implication:** Equity less tax-efficient than cash in Thailand; used selectively for key hires and alignment

### 6.2 Documentation Requirements
- **Option agreements:** Must comply with Thai employment law and Labor Protection Act
- **Board approval:** Required for all equity grants (recorded in minutes)
- **Company registration:** Option pool does not require registration until exercise/conversion

**Counsel review required:** Before executing first option grants.

## 7. Competitive Positioning

### 7.1 Thailand Startup Market
- **Equity compensation maturity:** Lower than Singapore/US; many Thai employees unfamiliar with options
- **Our strategy:** Use equity primarily for senior hires with prior startup experience; supplement with cash incentives for mid/junior levels
- **Education component:** Provide simple explainer on what options are, how vesting works, and upside potential

### 7.2 Recycling/Logistics Sector
- **Typical practice:** Most traditional logistics companies do not offer equity compensation
- **Competitive advantage:** Equity grants signal startup culture and upside potential; attractive to ambitious operators

## 8. Sources & References

### 8.1 Primary Sources
- **Y Combinator Startup School:** Equity compensation module (https://www.startupschool.org/)
- **Carta Equity Report 2023:** Published equity benchmarks from >10,000 private companies
- **Holloway Guide to Equity Compensation:** Comprehensive reference (2024 edition)
- **Index Ventures Handbook:** "Option Pool Shuffle" article + seed-stage equity guidelines

### 8.2 Regional Benchmarks (SE Asia)
- **Golden Gate Ventures:** "SE Asia Startup Compensation Guide 2023" (Singapore-based VC)
- **Jungle Ventures:** Portfolio company equity benchmarks (anecdotal; seed-stage 10-15% standard)
- **Thai Startup Association:** Limited public data; consulted informally (pending formal survey)

## 9. Policy Decision Rationale

**Why 12% post-money:**
1. **Aligned with global standards:** Falls in the 10-15% seed-stage range
2. **Competitive hiring capacity:** Can support 8-12 key hires over 18-24 months at standard grant bands
3. **Founder dilution:** Post-money treatment avoids hidden founder dilution
4. **Investor expectation:** Standard structure; no friction in term sheet negotiation
5. **Future flexibility:** 12% provides buffer for strategic hires without immediate refresh need

## 10. Approval & Sign-Off

**Recommendation:** Adopt 12% post-money option pool with vesting and grant band structure as documented.
