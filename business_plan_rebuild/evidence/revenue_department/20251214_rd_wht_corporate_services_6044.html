				4. Tax Calculation
			</h4></header><p>In the calculation of CIT of a company carrying on business in Thailand, it is calculated from the company's net profit on the accrual basis. A company shall take into account all revenue arising from or in consequence of the business carried on in an accounting period and deducting therefrom all expenses in accordance with the condition prescribed by the Revenue Code. As for dividend income, one-half of the dividends received by Thai companies from any other Thai companies may be excluded from the taxable income. However, the full amount may be excluded from taxable income if the recipient is a company listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand or the recipient owns at least 25% of the distributing company's capital interest, provided that the distributing company does not own a direct or indirect capital interest in the recipient company. The exclusion of dividends is applied only if the shares are acquired not less than 3 months before receiving the dividends and are not disposed of within 3 months after receiving the dividends.</p><p>In calculating CIT, deductible expenses are as follows:</p><p></p><ol><li>Ordinary and necessary expenses. However, the deductible amount of the following expenses is allowed at a special rate: 	<ul><li>200% deduction of Research and Development expense,</li><li>200% deduction of job training expense,</li><li>200% deduction of expenditure on the provision of equipment for the disabled;</li></ul></li><li>Interest, except interest on capital reserves or funds of the company;</li><li>Taxes, except for Corporate Income Tax and Value Added Tax paid to the Thai government;</li><li>Net losses carried forward from the last five accounting periods;</li><li>Bad debts;</li><li>Wear and tear;</li><li>Donations of up to 2% of net profits;</li><li>Provident fund contributions;</li><li>Entertainment expenses up to 0.3% of gross receipt but not exceeding 10 million baht;</li><li>Further tax deduction for donations made to public education institutions, and also for any expenses used for the maintenance of public parks, public playgrounds, and/or sports grounds;</li><li>Depreciation: Provided that in no case shall the deduction exceed the following percentage of cost as shown below. However, if a company adopts an accounting method, which the depreciation rates vary from year to year, the company is allowed to do so provided that the number of years over which an asset depreciated shall not be less than 100 divided by the percentage prescribed below.</li></ol><p></p><table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center"><strong>Types of Assets</strong></td><td style="text-align:center"><strong>Depreciation Rates</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>1.
