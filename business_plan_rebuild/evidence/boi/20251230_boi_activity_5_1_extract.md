**Document Date:** 2025-12-30  
**Prepared by:** Legal/Compliance  
**Source:** BOI Guide 2023 (English edition): `evidence/boi/20251215_boi_a_guide_2023_en.pdf`  
**Purpose:** Evidence artifact extracting key provisions for Activity 5.1 (Recycling) to support BOI decision analysis

## 1. Activity Classification

**Category:** 5 — Environmental Services  
**Activity:** 5.1 — Recycling and Disposal of Waste and Scrap  
**BOI Merit Level:** A1 (High Priority Activity)

---

## 2. Eligible Business Activities (Activity 5.1 Scope)

### 2.1 Included Activities
Per BOI Guide 2023, Activity 5.1 covers:

1. **Recycling of materials:**
   - Plastic waste (post-consumer and post-industrial)
   - Paper and cardboard
   - Metal (ferrous and non-ferrous)
   - Glass
   - Electronic waste (e-waste)
   - Textile waste
   - Rubber and tire recycling

2. **Processing and conversion:**
   - Sorting, cleaning, shredding, pelletizing
   - Chemical recycling (advanced recycling technologies)
   - Waste-to-energy (if primary purpose is material recovery)

3. **Collection and logistics** (if integrated with recycling operations):
   - Collection of recyclable materials
   - Transportation to recycling facility
   - Sorting and separation at centralized facility

4. **Hazardous waste treatment:**
   - Industrial hazardous waste recycling/disposal
   - Medical waste treatment (requires additional permits from MNRE)

### 2.2 Excluded Activities
The following are **NOT covered** under Activity 5.1 (would require separate BOI application or different activity code):
- Waste collection only (without recycling/processing component)
- Landfill operation (classified under waste disposal, not recycling)
- Incineration without energy recovery
- Composting of organic waste (classified under agricultural processing)

**Recycling25 fit:** Our business model (collection + sorting + baling for resale to processors) **is included** under Activity 5.1 scope. The "integrated collection + sorting" model qualifies as recycling activity.

| Incentive | Details | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **Corporate Income Tax (CIT) exemption** | 100% exemption from CIT | 8 years from first revenue (or first profit, whichever is earlier) |
| **Import duty exemption** | Machinery and equipment for recycling/sorting | During project construction/installation period |
| **Import duty reduction (50%)** | Raw materials for first 5 years | For imported recyclable materials (if applicable) |

**Additional incentives for Zone 3 (provincial areas):**
- CIT exemption: 8 years
- 50% CIT reduction for additional 5 years (total 13 years of benefits)

## 4. Minimum Investment Requirements (Activity 5.1)

### 4.1 Investment Thresholds by Zone
| Zone | Geographic Coverage | Minimum Investment (THB) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Zone 1** | Bangkok, Samut Prakan, Nonthaburi, Nakhon Pathom (inner metro) | **3,000,000** | Highest threshold; limited incentives |
| **Zone 2** | Pathum Thani, Samut Sakhon, Phuket (outer metro + tourist areas) | **1,500,000** | Moderate threshold |
| **Zone 3** | All other provinces (outside metro regions) | **1,000,000** | Lowest threshold; maximum incentives |

**Definition of "investment":** Fixed assets and capital expenditure, including:
- Machinery and equipment (recycling, sorting, processing)
- Vehicles (if dedicated to recycling operations)
- Facility construction or improvements (if owned or leased with significant capex)
- Technology and software (if integral to recycling process)

**Excluded from "investment" calculation:**
- Land cost
- Working capital (cash reserves, inventory)
- Pre-operating expenses (market research, legal fees, applications)
- Leased assets (unless significant down payment or improvements)

### 4.2 Recycling25 Context
**Our planned investment:** ~950,000 THB
- Fleet: ~500k THB (down payment + insurance)
- Facility equipment: ~450k THB (baler, bins, scales, facility deposit)

**Our location:** Bangkok (Zone 1)

**Gap:** We are **below the 3M THB Zone 1 threshold** by ~2M THB. Options:
1. Increase capex (buy vs lease; larger facility; own vs lease vehicle)
2. Relocate facility to Zone 3 (provincial area; operationally suboptimal for Bangkok pilot)
3. Do not pursue BOI (decision: YES, see `boi_decision_memo.md`)

## 5. Conditions & Obligations (Activity 5.1)

### 5.1 Application Requirements
To apply for BOI promotion under Activity 5.1:

**Documentation required:**
1. Business plan (3-5 years) with financial projections
2. Detailed investment breakdown (fixed assets, machinery, facility)
3. Technical process description (recycling methodology, equipment specs)
4. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) or exemption letter (depending on scale)
5. Company registration documents (certificate of incorporation, shareholder register)
6. Feasibility study (market demand, input/output volumes, pricing)

**Approval timeline:** 30-90 days typical (if complete application); longer if additional info requested.

**Application fee:** None (BOI promotion is free); legal/consulting fees for application preparation typically 50-150k THB.

### 5.2 Annual Reporting & Compliance
BOI-promoted companies must:

**Annual report (Form Por.Por. 3):**
- Financial statements (audited or certified by accountant)
- Operations report (volumes recycled, revenue by activity, employment)
- Compliance statement (confirming adherence to promoted activity scope)
- Due date: Within 150 days of fiscal year end

**Quarterly reports (during first 3 years):**
- Progress updates during construction/ramp-up phase
- Milestone achievement (commencement of operations, revenue targets)

**Inspection & audit:**
- BOI may conduct on-site inspections (annual or ad-hoc)
- Financial records, operations logs, and equipment must be available for review

**Penalties for non-compliance:**
- Failure to submit reports: Warning → fines → promotion revocation
- Deviation from approved business plan: BOI may revoke promotion and assess retroactive taxes

### 5.3 Activity Restrictions
**Promoted activity scope:** Once promoted under Activity 5.1, company must focus primarily on recycling operations. Revenue from non-promoted activities (e.g., consulting, software, unrelated services) must be:
- **<30% of total revenue** (typical BOI threshold), OR
- Approved separately by BOI as ancillary activity

**Pivot risk:** If company pivots away from recycling (e.g., becomes pure software/SaaS company), BOI promotion is at risk.

**Material changes:** Any significant change to business plan (location, investment scale, activity type) requires BOI approval before implementation.

### 5.4 Employment & Thai Staff Ratio
**Minimum Thai staff ratio (Activity 5.1):**
- **Managerial/technical roles:** No minimum (foreign employees allowed based on investment quota)
- **Operational/non-managerial roles:** At least 5 Thai workers per 1 foreign worker

**Recycling25 context:** Operations-heavy business (drivers, sorters); naturally high Thai staff ratio. No issue meeting BOI requirements.

---

## 6. Work Permit & Visa Privileges (Detailed)

### 6.1 Foreign Employee Quota
**Standard calculation:**
- 1 foreign employee per 2,000,000 THB invested
- Example: 3M THB investment → 1.5 foreign employee slots (round up to 2)

**Recycling25 example:**
- If we invested 3M THB (to meet Zone 1 threshold): 1-2 foreign employee slots
- Current plan (~950k investment): 0 foreign employee slots under BOI formula

**Conclusion:** Work permit privileges are not material benefit for our business (no immediate foreign hiring needs).

### 6.2 Visa & Work Permit Processing
**BOI One-Stop Service Center benefits:**
- Single point of contact (vs multiple government agencies)
- Faster processing: 7-14 days typical (vs 30-60 days standard)
- Multi-year work permits: Up to 4 years (vs 1-year renewable standard)
- Dependent visas: Expedited for spouses and children

**Documentation required (same as standard process):**
- Employment contract
- Company BOI promotion certificate
- Educational credentials / professional qualifications
- Passport and visa documents

## 7. Revocation Risk & Penalties

### 7.1 Grounds for BOI Promotion Revocation
BOI may revoke promotion if:
1. **Failure to commence operations** within approved timeline (typically 1-3 years from approval)
2. **Material deviation from business plan** (e.g., change in activity, investment shortfall)
3. **Non-compliance with reporting obligations** (repeated failure to file annual reports)
4. **Fraud or misrepresentation** in application or reports
5. **Breach of Foreign Business Act** (if non-promoted activities violate FBA and company loses exemption)

### 7.2 Consequences of Revocation
- **Loss of tax benefits:** Must pay retroactive CIT on exempted income (with interest and penalties)
- **Loss of foreign ownership exemption:** Company may be forced to divest foreign shareholders to <49% (if service business under FBA List 3)
- **Import duty clawback:** Must pay back exempted/reduced import duties (if applicable)
- **Reputational damage:** Difficulty raising capital or securing future BOI promotion

### 7.3 Mitigation
- Maintain detailed compliance records (annual reports, financial statements, operations logs)
- Obtain BOI approval before any material business plan change
- Engage Thai accountant familiar with BOI reporting requirements
- Conduct annual internal compliance audit

## 9. Key Takeaways for Recycling25

### 9.1 Eligibility: YES
Our business model (integrated collection + sorting + baling) is eligible under Activity 5.1.

### 9.2 Incentives: Modest Value
- 8-year CIT exemption worth ~1.2-1.5M THB (NPV) over 8 years
- Foreign ownership flexibility (not currently needed; revenue-share structure solves this)
- Work permit benefits (not material; no foreign hiring planned)

### 9.3 Requirements: Below Threshold
- Zone 1 (Bangkok) minimum: 3M THB
- Our plan: ~950k THB
- Would need to increase capex by 2M+ THB or relocate to Zone 3 (suboptimal)

### 9.4 Obligations: Significant Burden
- Annual reporting: ~30-50k THB/year + founder time
- Activity restrictions: Limits pivot flexibility during validation phase
- Revocation risk: If business model changes materially

### 9.5 Decision: NOT RECOMMENDED (Seed Stage)
Cost-benefit does not favor BOI at seed stage. Revisit at Series A if:
- Foreign investor demands >49% ownership
- Profitability scales (tax savings more material)
- Business model stabilizes (reduced pivot risk)
