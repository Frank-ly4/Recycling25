# RACI Matrix & Board Structure Documentation

**Document Date:** 2025-12-30  
**Prepared by:** Governance / Founder Team  
**Purpose:** Evidence artifact defining responsibility assignment (RACI) and board/advisory governance structure for investor diligence

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Recycling25 has established a clear RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix for 15 key business functions, defining decision authority across founders, finance lead, legal/compliance, advisors, and board.

**Board structure:** 2 founders (voting directors) + 1 investor observer (post-investment, non-voting) → evolves to 3-person board at Series A if investor holds ≥20%.

**Advisory board:** 3 advisors (legal, industry, finance) providing domain expertise without governance/voting rights.

## 2. RACI Matrix (Full Detail)

### 2.1 Matrix Legend
- **R (Responsible):** Does the work / executes the task
- **A (Accountable):** Ultimate decision authority / approves outcome (ONLY ONE per function)
- **C (Consulted):** Input sought before decision / two-way communication
- **I (Informed):** Kept informed after decision / one-way communication

### 2.2 Function-by-Function Breakdown

| Function / Decision | Founder 1 (CEO/Commercial) | Founder 2 (Ops) | Finance Lead | Legal/Compliance | Advisors | Board |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

## 6. Decision-Making Examples (RACI in Action)

### Example 1: New Customer Contract (Standard Terms, 300k THB/year)
- **R/A:** Founder 1 (CEO/Commercial) negotiates and signs
- **C:** Founder 2 (Ops) consulted on service feasibility
- **I:** Finance Lead informed (for revenue forecast update)
- **Board:** Informed in monthly board pack
- **Outcome:** No board approval required (Tier 1 authority)

### Example 2: Fleet Lease Agreement (500k THB down payment + 3-year lease)
- **R:** Founder 2 (Ops) negotiates terms and vendor selection
- **A:** Founder 1 (CEO) and Board approve (material contract >500k)
- **C:** Finance Lead (cash flow impact), Legal/Compliance (lease terms review)
- **I:** Investor observer (material capex decision)
- **Outcome:** Board resolution required (Tier 2 authority)

### Example 3: Equity Issuance (10% to new investor)
- **R:** Finance Lead prepares cap table impact and dilution analysis
- **A:** Board approves (reserved matter)
- **C:** Legal/Compliance (SHA compliance, FBA threshold check), Finance Advisor (valuation fairness)
- **Board vote:** Requires unanimous founder consent (>1% cap table change; Tier 3)
- **Outcome:** Board resolution + founder sign-off required

### Example 4: Annual Budget Approval (1.8M THB operating budget)
- **R:** Finance Lead prepares budget (revenue forecast, opex, capex)
- **C:** Founder 1 (sales targets), Founder 2 (ops costs), Legal/Compliance (regulatory costs)
- **A:** Board approves (Tier 2 authority)

### Example 5: Hiring Ops Manager (0.25% equity grant)
- **R/A:** Founder 2 (Ops) leads hiring process and makes offer
- **C:** Founder 1 (culture fit), Finance Lead (compensation benchmarking)
- **Board:** Approves equity grant (0.25% requires board approval per option pool policy)
- **Outcome:** Hiring decision = Tier 1 (founder authority); equity grant = Tier 2 (board approval)

## 8. Benchmarking & Best Practices

### 8.1 RACI Best Practices (from Governance Literature)
**Key principles:**
- **One A per function:** Avoids ambiguity and decision paralysis
- **Minimize C roles:** Too many "consulted" slows decisions
- **Clear R vs A split:** Doer (R) vs decision authority (A) must be distinct
- **Document exceptions:** When RACI is overridden, record in minutes

**Source:** PMI (Project Management Institute) RACI framework; Harvard Business Review governance articles

### 8.2 Seed-Stage Board Benchmarks
**Typical seed-stage board:**
- 2 founders (most common)
- 1-2 investor observers (if lead investor or multiple investors)
- Transition to 3-person board at Series A (2 founders + 1 investor director)

**Meeting cadence benchmarks:**
- Monthly: 60% of seed-stage companies (during high-growth/pilot phase)
- Quarterly: 30% of seed-stage companies (post-product-market fit)
- Ad-hoc: 10% (very early or part-time founders)

**Source:** Carta governance data (2023); FirstRound Capital "State of Startups" report

### 8.3 Advisory Board Benchmarks
**Typical advisory equity compensation:**
- **Early advisor (pre-seed):** 0.5-1.5% (higher impact, earlier risk)
- **Seed-stage advisor:** 0.25-0.75% (established product, lower risk)
- **Part-time advisor (ad-hoc):** 0.1-0.25% or hourly/retainer (limited commitment)

**Vesting standard:** 2-4 years (vs 4 years for employees); 6-month or 1-year cliff
