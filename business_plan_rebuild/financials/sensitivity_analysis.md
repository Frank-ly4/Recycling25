# Sensitivity Analysis

## 1. Variable Impact Summary
We tested the model against three critical variables: **Service Fee**, **Building Ramp Speed**, and **Fuel Costs**.

### Base Case vs. Scenarios (Month 12 Snapshot)
*   **Base Case:** 9 Buildings (3,600 units), 90 THB/unit.
    *   **Profit:** 69,000 THB/month.

### Scenario A: Price Pressure (-10%)
*   **Condition:** Competition forces price down to 80 THB/unit.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Revenue decreases by 36,000 THB (3,600 units * 10 THB).
    *   **New Profit:** 33,000 THB/month.
*   **Mitigation:** Must scale to 11 buildings to recover 60k profit target.

### Scenario B: Slow Ramp (Delay 3 months)
*   **Condition:** Reaching 9 buildings takes 15 months instead of 12.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cash burn extends.
    *   Month 12 Profit (at 6 buildings): ~18,000 THB/month.
*   **Buffer:** Seed capital (1.2M) provides runway for 18 months of burn if needed (Cash low point ~900k in base case, remains healthy).

### Scenario C: Fuel Spike (+20%)
*   **Condition:** Diesel prices rise significantly.
*   **Impact:** Fuel cost rises from ~42k to ~50k (+8k).
*   **New Profit:** 61,000 THB/month.
*   **Resilience:** High. Fuel is a small % of OPEX compared to labor and fleet lease.

## 2. Break-Even Analysis
*   **Operational Break-Even:** Occurs at **6 Buildings** (2,400 units).
*   **Profit Target (60k):** Occurs at **9 Buildings** (3,600 units) in Base Case.

## 3. Recommendation
Maintain firm pricing floor at 85 THB/unit. If forced lower, require larger clusters (min 5 buildings) to reduce variable logistics costs.
