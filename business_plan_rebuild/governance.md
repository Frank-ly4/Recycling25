## 3. Board Composition & Advisory Roster

### 3.1 Board of Directors (Current Composition)
**Structure:** 2 founders (voting directors) + 1 investor observer (non-voting, post-investment)

**Series A (if ≥20% investor ownership):**
- 3 voting directors: 2 founders + 1 investor director
- Quorum: 2 of 3 directors
- Reserved matters: investor director consent required for material decisions

**Series B+ (if institutional investors):**
- Consider adding independent director (industry expert, finance, governance)
- Typical board composition: 2 founders + 1-2 investor directors + 1 independent

**Requirement:** Any director or advisor with a potential conflict must disclose before board discussion and recuse from voting.

**Common conflicts:**
- Related-party transactions (family, other businesses)
- Competing business interests
- Personal financial interest in decision outcome (beyond proportional ownership)

**Process:**
1. Disclose conflict at start of meeting
2. Board discusses without conflicted party present
3. Conflicted party may answer questions but does not participate in vote
4. Conflict and recusal recorded in board minutes

## 4. Approval Gates
Each artifact must pass the following gates before being marked "FINAL":

### Gate 1: Structure & Completeness
- [ ] File exists in correct directory.
- [ ] Follows standard markdown/JSON structure (or appropriate data format).
- [ ] All sections defined in the plan are present.

### Gate 2: Evidence Check
- [ ] Key claims have citations (e.g., "Source: REIC 2024", "Source: Supplier Quote").
- [ ] Assumptions are explicitly flagged (e.g., "ASSUMPTION—VALIDATE").
- [ ] All material claims are tracked in `evidence_register.json` with status (verified vs assumption) and validation method.
- [ ] Financial figures align with `financials/model_inputs.json` and generated outputs (`financials/projections.json`, `financials/cashflow.json`, `financials/waterfall.json`).

### Gate 3: Investor Readiness
- [ ] Tone is professional, concise, and persuasive.
- [ ] Risks are acknowledged and mitigated.
- [ ] Formatting is clean (headers, tables, lists).

## 4. Change Management
- All changes to finalized documents must be logged in `audit_trail.jsonl`.
- Significant strategic pivots (e.g., pricing model change) require full team consensus.

## 5. Acceptance Tests
- **Financial Viability**: Model shows ≥60k THB/month profit by Month 18.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Legal doc cites specific BMA/DLT regulations.
- **Operational Reality**: Ops plan accounts for Bangkok traffic, waste density, and labor laws.

## 6. Option Pool Policy

**Purpose:** Define equity incentive structure for attracting and retaining key talent while managing founder dilution.

### 6.1 Pool Size
- **Proposed size:** 12% of fully diluted post-money capitalization
- **Rationale:** Standard seed-stage range is 10-15%; 12% provides competitive hiring capacity without excessive founder dilution
- **Treatment:** Pool created **post-money** (investor bears proportional dilution cost)
- **Benchmark source:** BENCHMARK—EXTERNAL: Typical seed-stage startups in SE Asia establish 10-15% option pools (Y Combinator standard, 500 Startups guidelines)

### 6.2 Vesting Schedule
- **Standard vesting:** 4 years with 1-year cliff
- **Vesting cadence:** Monthly vesting after cliff (1/48th per month after month 12)
- **Acceleration:** Single-trigger acceleration on acquisition/exit (50% immediate vest); double-trigger for founder grants
- **Founder vesting:** Founders subject to same 4-year vesting to align with investor expectations

### 6.3 Exercise Window
- **Post-termination exercise:** 90 days after termination (standard market practice)
- **Extension consideration:** May extend to 10 years for long-tenured employees (case-by-case, board approval)

### 6.4 Grant Bands by Role Level
Equity grants sized by role criticality and market benchmarks:

| Role Level | Grant Range (% of FD) | Typical Roles |
|---|---|---|
| **Co-founder / Late founder** | 1.0% - 3.0% | Joining after incorporation but pre-Series A |
| **C-level / Head of Function** | 0.5% - 1.5% | COO, Head of Sales, Head of Ops (if not founder) |
| **Senior / Lead** | 0.25% - 1.0% | Senior ops manager, senior sales lead, key processor relationships |
| **Mid-level** | 0.10% - 0.25% | Facility manager, driver lead, accounting manager |
| **Junior / Individual contributor** | 0.05% - 0.10% | Drivers, sorters, admin staff (if equity appropriate) |

**Note:** Bands are guidelines; actual grants depend on hire timing (earlier = larger), market conditions, and negotiation.

### 6.5 Approval Process
- **Grants >0.5% of FD:** Require full board approval (documented in board minutes)
- **Grants 0.1% - 0.5%:** Require founder/CEO approval with Finance Lead sign-off
- **Grants <0.1%:** Founder/CEO approval only (batch approval acceptable)
- **Annual review:** Board reviews pool usage and refresh triggers quarterly during active hiring

### 6.6 Refresh Policy
Pool replenishment triggers:
- **Trigger 1:** When unallocated pool drops below 5% of FD (prevents running out mid-hiring)
- **Trigger 2:** At next funding round (typical to refresh to 10-12% post-money)
- **Trigger 3:** Strategic hire requiring >1% grant and insufficient pool (ad-hoc refresh with board approval)

### 6.7 Strike Price / Valuation
- **409A or equivalent:** Use independent valuation or most recent funding round price
- **Pre-funding grants:** Use founder price or nominal value (0.01 THB/share) until first priced round
- **Tax treatment:** Grants are taxable benefit in Thailand; company and employee responsible for compliance (consult Thai tax advisor)

### 6.8 Documentation & Administration
- **Option agreements:** Standard form option agreement (counsel-drafted) with vesting schedule, exercise price, and termination provisions
- **Cap table tracking:** All grants recorded in `cap_table.md` with grant date, holder, shares, strike price, vesting status
- **Annual reporting:** Provide option holders with annual statements showing vested/unvested shares and current valuation

## 8. Standard Investor Rights Clauses

**Purpose:** Define standard protective provisions and transfer rights for equity investors (if equity structure is chosen over revenue-share).

### 8.1 Drag-Along Rights
- **Trigger:** If holders of ≥66.7% of outstanding shares (on fully diluted basis) approve a sale of the company
- **Effect:** All shareholders (including minority holders) must sell their shares on the same terms
- **Rationale:** Prevents minority blockers from killing favorable exits; standard in all venture-backed companies
- **Limitations:**
  - Sale price must represent fair market value (or premium to last funding round)
  - Minority shareholders receive pro-rata proceeds on same terms as majority
  - Founders can negotiate carve-out for sales <2x last valuation (protection against fire-sale)

### 8.2 Tag-Along Rights (Co-Sale Rights)
- **Trigger:** If founder(s) or majority shareholders propose to sell shares to a third party
- **Effect:** Minority investors have the right (but not obligation) to "tag along" and sell proportional shares on same terms
- **Rationale:** Protects minority from being left in illiquid position if founders exit
- **Typical terms:**
  - Applies to transfers >10% of company
  - Does not apply to estate planning transfers or family trusts
  - Investor notified 30 days in advance; 15 days to elect to participate

### 8.3 Right of First Refusal (ROFR)
- **Trigger:** Any shareholder proposes to sell shares to a third party
- **Effect:** Company (and optionally, other shareholders) have first right to purchase on same terms as proposed sale
- **Order of priority:**
  1. Company may purchase (prevents unwanted third parties on cap table)
  2. If company declines, existing shareholders may purchase pro-rata
  3. If both decline, selling shareholder may proceed with third-party sale
- **Exercise period:** 30 days from notice

### 8.4 Information Rights

### 8.6 Founder Lockup & Vesting
- **Vesting:** Founders subject to 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (same as employees; see Section 6)
- **Rationale:** Aligns founder incentives with long-term value creation; prevents premature founder departure
- **Acceleration:** Single-trigger 50% vest on exit; double-trigger for involuntary termination post-exit
- **Transfer restrictions:** Founder shares subject to ROFR and board approval for any transfer

### 8.7 Non-Compete & IP Assignment (Founder-Specific)

- **Amendment:** SHA amendments require unanimous shareholder consent (or supermajority per SHA terms)

**Status:** Draft clauses above; SHA execution required at time of equity investment.

## 9. Cap Table Control Process
**Purpose:** Maintain accurate, investor-grade ownership records and prevent dilution surprises.

### 6.1 Source of Truth
