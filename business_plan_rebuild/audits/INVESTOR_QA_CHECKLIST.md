# Investor QA Checklist (Due Diligence Defense)

**Purpose:** This list anticipates the "hard questions" sophisticated investors will ask during diligence and points to the specific document or evidence that answers them.

## 1. Commercial & Market
*   [ ] **"Is the 90 THB/unit fee realistic?"**
    *   *Answer:* Validated via [Pilot Validation Plan](audits/pilot_validation.md). Pricing stress-tested in [Sensitivity Analysis](../financials/sensitivity_analysis.md) (Price -10% scenario).
*   [ ] **"Why won't condos just use free BMA collection?"**
    *   *Answer:* BMA collection is mixed-waste only (60 THB/unit/month fee pressure) or unreliable. We provide the *ESG Audit Trail* (Diversion Report) that Juristic Managers need for corporate reporting. See [ESG Sales Talking Points](../outreach_kit/ESG_sales_talking_points.md).
*   [ ] **"What prevents a price war with informal collectors?"**
    *   *Answer:* Professional insurance, VAT invoices, and digital reporting. Informal collectors cannot provide the "Chain of Custody" required by publicly listed developers (Sansiri/AP).

## 2. Operations & Asset
*   [ ] **"Can your trucks actually fit in older condo basements?"**
    *   *Answer:* Yes. We use a **Mixed Fleet Strategy** (Isuzu NPR for street loading + Suzuki Carry for <2.1m basements). See [Operations Plan](../operations_plan.md) Section 3 and [Vehicle Specs](../audits/vehicle_specs_comparison.md).
*   [ ] **"What happens if your truck breaks down?"**
    *   *Answer:* Our lease with Siam Rajathanee includes a replacement vehicle SLA (24-48 hours).
*   [ ] **"Do you have a license to operate?"**
    *   *Answer:* We file for the BMA "Business Detrimental to Health" permit. For transport, we use the "License Bridge" (leasing via a licensed operator) in Year 1. See [Legal Compliance](../legal_compliance.md).

## 3. Financials
*   [ ] **"When do you run out of cash?"**
    *   *Answer:* Base case low point is **Month 15 (cash_end = -23,040 THB)** due to the quarterly investor revenue-share payment schedule. Mitigated by strict advance billing / Net-15 collection discipline and maintaining a small working-capital buffer. See [Cashflow](../financials/cashflow.json).
*   [ ] **"Are you actually profitable by Month 12?"**
    *   *Answer:* In the generated base case, **Month 12 net income is 16,800 THB** and the **≥60k net income threshold is reached in Month 15 (72,000 THB)**. See [Projections](../financials/projections.json).
*   [ ] **"Why is the ROI so slow (4.5 years)?"**
    *   *Answer:* It's a conservative revenue-share model with a 1.5x cap; the cap is reached at **Month 54** in the current generated waterfall. We prioritize *safety of principal* (contracted recurring revenue) over moonshot growth. See [Waterfall](../financials/waterfall.json).
*   [ ] **"Are these numbers just guesses?"**
    *   *Answer:* Drivers are derived from [Model Inputs](../financials/model_inputs.json) based on market quotes (lease, rent, wages) tracked in the [Evidence Register](../evidence_register.json).

## 4. Legal & Governance
*   [ ] **"Who owns the IP/Data?"**
    *   *Answer:* The Thai Company. Resident data is minimized to avoid PDPA liability.
*   [ ] **"Can the founders walk away?"**
    *   *Answer:* Vesting schedule applies (Standard 4-year).
*   [ ] **"Is the contract enforceable?"**
    *   *Answer:* Yes, based on Thai Civil Code. Includes specific clauses for contamination penalties and access guarantees. See [Contract Template](../outreach_kit/contract_template.md).
