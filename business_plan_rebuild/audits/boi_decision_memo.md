# BOI Pathway Decision Memo (Draft)

## 1. Decision
- **Default (current):** Operate as a Thai limited company with Thai-majority ownership to avoid Foreign Business Act service restrictions (per `legal_compliance.md`).
- **BOI pathway:** Optional; pursue only if we need (a) foreign ownership flexibility, (b) specific tax/non-tax incentives that materially improve economics, or (c) foreign expert hiring facilitation.

## 2. What BOI changes (benchmark)
- BOI guide indicates (a) minimum capital investment language (general rule: 1M THB excluding land/working capital unless specified otherwise) and (b) eligible activity list entries related to recycling/sorting/waste treatment.
- Evidence archived:
  - `evidence/boi/20251215_boi_a_guide_2023_en.pdf`
  - `evidence/boi/20251215_SEARCH_LOG.md`

## 3. Costs / burdens
- Ongoing compliance and reporting obligations; risk of privilege revocation if conditions not met.

## 4. Recommendation (next 12–18 months)
- **Recommendation:** Defer BOI application until:
  - we have validated unit economics in the pilot, and
  - we have a clear operational classification posture (DLT) and stable compliance baseline.

## 5. Close criteria (to finalize this memo)
- Identify the most relevant BOI activity category and confirm specific conditions.
- Produce a BOI vs non-BOI economics comparison (tax savings vs compliance/admin cost).
- Decide: BOI apply now vs later, and update BOI Q&A entries accordingly.
