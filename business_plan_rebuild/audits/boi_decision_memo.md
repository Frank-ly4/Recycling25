# BOI Pathway Decision Memo

**Document Date:** 2025-12-30  
**Prepared by:** Legal/Compliance + Finance  
**Reviewed by:** Business Owner / Founders  
**Decision Status:** **RECOMMENDATION: NO** (Do not pursue BOI promotion at seed stage)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Decision:** Recycling25 should **NOT pursue Board of Investment (BOI) promotion** at seed stage. Instead, maintain Thai-majority corporate structure (≥51% Thai ownership) to remain FBA-compliant without BOI administrative burden.

**Rationale:** While BOI Activity 5.1 (Recycling and Disposal of Waste) offers tax incentives and foreign ownership flexibility, the **compliance burden, minimum investment thresholds, and activity restrictions outweigh benefits** for a 1.5M THB seed-stage company focused on rapid pilot validation.

**Revisit trigger:** Reassess at Series A (if ≥10M THB raise, significant foreign investor demand, or need for 100% foreign ownership).

---

## 2. BOI Background & Activity 5.1 Eligibility

### 2.1 What is BOI?
The **Board of Investment (BOI)** is Thailand's investment promotion agency under the Investment Promotion Act B.E. 2520 (1977). BOI offers tax and non-tax incentives to companies in promoted industries to encourage investment, technology transfer, and economic development.

**Authority:** Prime Minister's Office > BOI  
**Website:** https://www.boi.go.th

### 2.2 Activity 5.1 — Recycling and Disposal of Waste and Scrap
**Category:** Environmental Services (Category 5)  
**Specific activity:** 5.1 — Recycling and Disposal of Waste and Scrap

**Eligible activities:**
- Collection, sorting, and processing of recyclable materials (paper, plastic, metal, glass)
- Waste-to-energy or waste-to-material conversion
- Hazardous waste treatment and disposal (requires additional permits)
- E-waste and industrial waste recycling

**Recycling25 eligibility:** **YES** — Our business model (collection + sorting + baling of recyclable plastics/metals from condos) falls squarely within Activity 5.1 scope.

---

## 3. BOI Incentives (Activity 5.1)

### 3.1 Tax Incentives (Typical Package)
| Incentive | Duration | Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| **Corporate Income Tax (CIT) exemption** | 8 years | Standard for Activity 5.1; starts from first profit or 8 years from revenue start (whichever is earlier) |
| **Import duty exemption** | During construction/installation | Machinery and equipment used for recycling/sorting (if imported) |
| **Import duty reduction** | 50% reduction | Raw materials/components for first 5 years (if applicable) |

**Note:** Activity 5.1 receives **A1 merit** (high priority) → typically 8-year CIT exemption without special conditions.

### 3.2 Non-Tax Incentives
- **Foreign ownership:** 100% foreign ownership permitted (exempt from Foreign Business Act List 3 restrictions)
- **Work permits & visas:** Streamlined process for foreign employees; quota relaxation for skilled technical staff
- **Land ownership:** BOI companies may own land for promoted activities (normally restricted for foreigners)
- **No restrictions on remittance:** Foreign currency remittance and repatriation fully allowed

### 3.3 Value of Tax Incentives (Recycling25 Context)
**8-year CIT exemption value:**
- Thailand CIT rate: 20% (standard)
- Recycling25 projected profit (Year 3 onward): ~1M THB/year
- Annual CIT savings: ~200,000 THB/year
- **Total 8-year NPV:** ~1.2-1.5M THB (discounted)

**Import duty exemption:** Not material (no significant machinery imports planned; leasing local equipment).

**Total incentive value:** ~1.2-1.5M THB over 8 years (meaningful but not transformative for seed-stage company).

## 4. BOI Requirements & Obligations

### 4.1 Minimum Investment Thresholds
**Activity 5.1 minimum investment:**
- **Zone 1-2 (Bangkok, high-development areas):** 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 THB minimum investment (excluding land/working capital)
- **Zone 3 (provincial areas):** Lower thresholds (500,000 - 1,000,000 THB)

**Definition of "investment":** Fixed assets (machinery, equipment, facility improvements, vehicles). Excludes working capital, inventory, and land.

**Recycling25 planned investment:**
- Fleet (Isuzu NPR + lease): ~500,000 THB (down payment + insurance)
- Facility (warehouse deposit + equipment): ~450,000 THB (baler, bins, scales)
- **Total fixed assets:** ~950,000 THB

**Status:** **Below Bangkok Zone 1-2 threshold** (1M THB minimum). Would need to either:
1. Increase capital expenditure (buy vs lease fleet; larger facility), OR
2. Locate facility in Zone 3 (provincial area; operationally suboptimal for Bangkok pilot)

### 4.2 Annual Compliance & Reporting
BOI-promoted companies must:
- **Annual report submission:** Operations report + financial statements to BOI (Form Por.Por. 3) within 150 days of fiscal year end
- **Quarterly progress reports:** During first 3 years (construction/ramp-up phase)
- **Audit & inspection:** BOI may audit operations, financial records, and compliance with promoted activity scope
- **Activity restrictions:** Company must focus on promoted activity (5.1 recycling); any side business or revenue diversification requires BOI approval
- **Employment & Thai staff ratio:** Minimum Thai staff ratio (typically 5:1 Thai:foreign for non-managerial roles; varies by activity)

**Administrative burden:** ~5-10 days/year (reports, coordination); requires Thai accounting firm familiar with BOI reporting.

### 4.3 Revocation Risk & Penalties
BOI promotion can be **revoked** if:
- Company fails to commence operations within approved timeline (typically 1-3 years from approval)
- Company materially deviates from approved business plan (e.g., pivots away from recycling)
- Annual reporting obligations not met (repeated non-filing)
- Fraud or misrepresentation in BOI application

**Penalty:** Loss of tax benefits; retroactive CIT assessment (must pay back exempted taxes + penalties).

## 5. Cost-Benefit Analysis

### 5.1 Benefits (Quantified)
| Benefit | Value (THB) | Timing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **8-year CIT exemption** | 1,200,000 - 1,500,000 | Years 1-8 | NPV ~1.2M THB (assuming profitability Year 3+) |
| **Foreign ownership flexibility** | Qualitative | Immediate | Allows 100% foreign investment (avoids 51% Thai threshold) |
| **Work permit facilitation** | Minor | As needed | Streamlined process; saves ~10-20k THB/permit + time |
| **Import duty savings** | ~0 | N/A | Not importing machinery |
| **Total tangible benefit** | ~1.2-1.5M THB | Over 8 years | |

### 5.2 Costs (Quantified + Qualitative)
| Cost | Value (THB) | Timing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Application fee & legal** | 50,000 - 150,000 | Upfront | BOI application preparation, counsel fees, translations |
| **Minimum capex increase** | 50,000 - 2,050,000 | Year 1 | If need to hit 1M THB threshold (vs current 950k plan) |
| **Annual BOI reporting** | 30,000 - 50,000 | Annual | Accountant/admin for Por.Por. 3 reports |
| **Compliance risk** | Qualitative | Ongoing | Activity restrictions limit pivot flexibility |
| **Opportunity cost (founder time)** | Significant | Months 1-6 | 20-40 hours founder time for application + coordination |
| **Total tangible cost** | 150,000 - 300,000 | Years 1-2 | Plus opportunity cost |

### 5.3 Net Benefit Calculation
- **Gross benefit (8-year NPV):** 1.2-1.5M THB
- **Upfront + 2-year costs:** 200-400k THB
- **Net benefit:** ~800k - 1.2M THB over 8 years
- **ROI:** Positive, but **spread over 8 years** and contingent on profitability

## 6. Strategic Considerations

### 6.1 Foreign Investor Demand (Current Reality Check)
**Assumption test:** Do we have foreign investors actively blocked by the 49% Foreign Business Act cap?

**Current state:**
- Seed raise: 1.5M THB (~$43k USD)
- Target investor profile: Thai angels, family offices, impact investors (primarily local/regional)
- Foreign VC interest: **Minimal at seed stage** (too early, too small ticket)

**Conclusion:** Foreign ownership flexibility is **NOT a current blocker**. Can maintain 51% Thai majority without constraining fundraising options.

**Revisit trigger:** If Series A targets foreign VCs (e.g., US/EU climate funds, impact VCs) requiring >49% ownership, BOI becomes more attractive.

### 6.2 Pivot Flexibility & Activity Restrictions
**BOI constraint:** Once promoted under Activity 5.1 (recycling), company must remain focused on that activity. Any material pivot (e.g., moving into waste-to-energy, starting a separate logistics business, SaaS revenue) requires BOI approval or risks promotion revocation.

**Recycling25 context:**
- **Pilot phase (Year 1):** High uncertainty; learning customer needs, refining model, testing pricing
- **Pivot risk:** Moderate (may discover adjacent revenue streams: consulting, software, data monetization)
- **Trade-off:** BOI locks us into "recycling services" business model

**Conclusion:** Premature to commit to activity restrictions when still validating product-market fit.

### 6.3 Administrative Bandwidth (Seed-Stage Reality)
**Founder time cost:** BOI application + annual compliance requires 30-50 hours/year founder time + accountant coordination.

**Alternative use of time:**
- Customer acquisition (sign 3-5 more pilots)
- Fundraising (close seed round faster)
- Operations (ensure zero stoppages, build reputation)

**Conclusion:** Founder time better spent on growth/validation than BOI administration at seed stage.

### 6.4 Revenue-Share Structure Removes FBA Constraint
**Key insight:** Recycling25's **primary fundraising structure is revenue-share** (see `investor_relations.md`), which is a debt instrument, not equity. Revenue-share is **NOT subject to Foreign Business Act** restrictions.

**Implication:**
- Foreign investors can participate via revenue-share without FBA constraint (no 49% cap)
- Equity is **secondary/optional** structure
- BOI promotion is unnecessary if revenue-share remains primary vehicle

**Conclusion:** Revenue-share structure already solves the foreign ownership problem; no need for BOI complexity.

## 7. Recommendation & Decision

### 7.1 Decision: NO (Do Not Pursue BOI at Seed Stage)
**Rationale:**
1. **Net benefit is modest (~1.2M THB over 8 years)** and contingent on profitability
2. **Upfront cost + opportunity cost outweigh near-term benefits** for seed-stage company
3. **Foreign ownership flexibility not currently needed** (revenue-share solves this; equity is secondary)
4. **Activity restrictions constrain pivot flexibility** during critical validation phase
5. **Administrative burden diverts founder time** from growth priorities
6. **Minimum investment threshold requires suboptimal capex decisions** (forced purchases vs leasing)

### 7.2 Alternative: Thai-Majority Structure (Recommended)
**Path forward:**
- Maintain ≥51% Thai ownership (Foreign Business Act compliant without BOI)
- Use **revenue-share as primary investment structure** (no FBA constraint)
- Offer **equity as secondary option** for investors who require it (capped at 49% foreign)
- **Revisit BOI at Series A** if foreign ownership >49% becomes critical

**Benefits of Thai-majority path:**
- No application delay (operational immediately)
- No annual BOI compliance burden
- Full pivot flexibility (not locked into Activity 5.1)
- Founder time focused on growth, not administration

### 7.3 Revisit Triggers (When to Reconsider BOI)
Reassess BOI if any of the following occur:
1. **Series A raise (≥10M THB):** Tax savings become more material (~400k/year at 2M profit)
2. **Foreign VC demand:** Lead investor requires >49% ownership or board control
3. **Significant capex increase:** If business model shifts to capital-intensive (e.g., own processing facility, machinery imports)
4. **Government procurement opportunity:** BOI status sometimes preferred for government contracts
5. **Business model stabilizes:** Once past pilot phase and confident in core model (reduced pivot risk)

---

## 8. Implementation (Thai-Majority Path)

### 8.1 Corporate Structure Steps
1. **Confirm current shareholder register** (Gap ID: CC-01, FIELD item)
2. **Ensure ≥51% Thai ownership** (if not already; adjust cap table if needed)
3. **Include FBA compliance covenant** in Shareholder Agreement (see `legal_compliance.md` Section 6)
4. **Track foreign ownership quarterly** (see `governance.md` Section 9 "Cap Table Control Process")

### 8.2 Investor Communication
**For Thai investors:** No issues; standard structure.

**For foreign investors:**
- **Primary offer:** Revenue-share structure (no FBA constraint; see `investor_relations.md`)
- **Secondary offer:** Equity option capped at 49% aggregate foreign ownership
- **Positioning:** "We're prioritizing operational speed and flexibility at seed stage; BOI promotion is on roadmap for Series A if needed."

### 8.3 Legal Docs to Prepare
- [x] Thai-majority maintenance covenant in SHA (counsel-drafted)
- [x] Foreign Business Act compliance process (documented in `legal_compliance.md` Section 6)
- [ ] Revenue-share agreement template (primary structure; see `investor_relations.md`)

- **Work permit processing:** Expedited (One-Stop Service Center at BOI)
- **Dependent visas:** Spouses and children of foreign employees get streamlined visa process
- **Renewal:** Multi-year work permits possible (vs 1-year standard)

**Recycling25 relevance:** Low (no immediate need for foreign employees in ops-heavy business).
