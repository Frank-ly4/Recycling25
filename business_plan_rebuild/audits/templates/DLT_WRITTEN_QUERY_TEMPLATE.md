**Subject:** Request for written guidance: recyclables pickup service model and required DLT licensing/registration

Dear [DLT office/contact name],

We are Recycling25 Co., Ltd. and plan to operate a recyclables pickup service in Bangkok.

### 1) Our service model (facts)
- We provide **scheduled pickups** at condominium juristic person buildings.
- We charge a **service fee** to the building for collection + reporting.
- Materials collected are **source-separated recyclables** (e.g., PET bottles, HDPE, aluminum cans) and are transported to our sorting/aggregation point.
- We may operate using (a) our own vehicle(s) and drivers or (b) a licensed partner/lessor arrangement.

### 2) Questions (please answer in writing)
1. Under this service model, is the vehicle operation treated as **transport-for-hire / non-scheduled truck transport** requiring a commercial transport operator license and/or yellow plate registration?
2. If **yes**, please specify:
   - required **license type(s)** for the operator/company,
   - required **vehicle registration/plate** class,
   - required **driver license** class,
   - any required **permits** for the facility/warehouse tied to the operator license.
3. If **no**, please specify what classification applies and what compliance steps we must follow.
4. If we operate under a **licensed partner/lessor** (the partner holds the operator license/plates and we are the service provider), what documentation should be carried on the vehicle during operations/inspections?

### 3) Attachments we can provide (on request)
- Draft service agreement scope and operating SOP summary.
- Vehicle details (type, GVW, photos).
