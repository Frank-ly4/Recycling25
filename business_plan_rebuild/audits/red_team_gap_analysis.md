# Red Team Gap Analysis: Business Plan Audit

**Date:** 2025-12-06
**Status:** CRITICAL FINDINGS - ACTION REQUIRED

## 1. Operational Gaps
### 1.1. The "Height Clearance" Trap
*   **Finding:** Standard Isuzu NPR trucks (~2.3m height) exceed the 2.1m clearance of many older condo loading docks.
*   **Impact:** Truck may be physically unable to enter 30% of target buildings, forcing "curbside loading" which blocks traffic and angers juristic.
*   **Required Action:** Add "Site Survey: Height Check" to the Sales Process. Limit fleet to "Low Profile" cage modifications if needed.

### 1.2. Truck Ban Windows
*   **Finding:** 4-wheel Jumbo trucks (if >2.2 tons) face rush-hour bans (06:00-09:00, 16:00-20:00) on surface roads.
*   **Impact:** Collection window is squeezed to 10:00-15:00 (5 hours).
*   **Required Action:** Route planning must account for strict "Mid-Day" windows. Driver cannot do >2 trips/day.

## 2. Regulatory & Legal Gaps
### 2.1. The "Yellow Plate" Lag
*   **Finding:** Obtaining a new Transport Operator License takes **90+ days**.
*   **Impact:** "Month 1 Launch" with own fleet is impossible.
*   **Required Action:** **MANDATORY** to lease/rent trucks from an existing operator for Months 1-6. The budget has been adjusted (28k lease), but the *operational plan* must explicitly state "Outsourced Fleet Phase".

### 2.2. Soft Enforcement Risk
*   **Finding:** BMA’s mixed-waste fee level (60 THB/month) and the separation discount (20 THB/month) exist on paper, but active enforcement / administrative uptake may be inconsistent.
*   **Impact:** The "Fear of Fine" sales pitch is weak.
*   **Required Action:** Pivot sales pitch to "Corporate ESG Reporting" (Sansiri/AP goals) which is a *hard* requirement from HQ, regardless of BMA/District enforcement.

## 3. Market Validation Gaps
### 3.1. Willingness to Pay (The 90 THB Bet)
*   **Finding:** No widespread precedent for condos paying ~36,000 THB/month purely for recycling. Most are used to *getting paid* (selling to saleng).
*   **Impact:** High risk of "Sticker Shock".
*   **Required Action:** Develop a "Hybrid Invoice": 
    *   Service Fee: 36,000
    *   Material Rebate: (5,000)
    *   **Net Invoice:** 31,000.
    *   *Psychology:* Showing a rebate (even if small) proves we are honest, unlike "free" collectors who take everything.

## 4. Financial Stress Test
*   **Scenario:** Net-60 Payment Delays.
*   **Result:** Cash trough hits ~600k in Month 6. **PASSED** (Buffer remains >500k).
*   **Scenario:** Zero Growth (Stuck at 5 bldgs).
*   **Result:** Burn rate ~126k/mo vs Revenue 180k. **Breakeven achieved.** **PASSED**.

## 5. Missing Artifacts
*   [ ] **Driver Employment Contract:** Needs specific clauses for "Condo Code of Conduct" (No smoking, uniform mandatory).
*   [ ] **Site Survey Checklist:** To catch height/width restrictions before signing contract.
