Document the methodology used to calculate environmental impact (CO₂e diversion) from collected recyclables.

## Inputs
- business_plan_rebuild/audits/DD_GAP_REGISTER_151225.md
- business_plan_rebuild/DATA_ROOM_INDEX.md
- business_plan_rebuild/outreach_kit/diversion_report_template.md (or equivalent diversion template)

## Outputs
**Artifacts**
- business_plan_rebuild/appendices/impact/impact_methodology.md

**Evidence**
- business_plan_rebuild/evidence/impact/20260102_co2e_factors.md

## Done when (binary)
- [ ] Methodology explains calculation logic (kg diverted → CO₂e), assumptions, and units
- [ ] CO₂e factors are listed with source + date (and scope notes if applicable)
- [ ] Evidence memo exists at the specified path
- [ ] DD_GAP_REGISTER row status is acceptable per RUNBOOK:
      `SOURCED_INTERNAL` is treated as CLOSED
- [ ] Status note begins with `CLOSED YYYY-MM-DD:` or `IN_PROGRESS YYYY-MM-DD:`
      (embedded date counts as Last updated)
- [ ] DATA_ROOM_INDEX row updated to CLOSED with owner + date
