# Pilot Validation Plan (First 90 Days)

**Objective:** Prove the "willingness to pay" 90 THB/unit and validate operational costs before Series A scaling.

## 1. The "Must-Verify" Hypotheses
| Area | Hypothesis | Validation Metric | Fail Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commercial** | Condos will pay ~36k/month for compliance + reliability. | **Signed Contract** (not just LOI) with deposit. | Sales cycle > 4 months or Price forced < 80 THB. |
| **Operational** | Mixed fleet (NPR + Suzuki Carry) can clear all Zone A basements. | **100% Pickup Success** (no failed access). | >10% of target buildings require "ferry" runs (too slow). |
| **Financial** | Contamination < 15% is achievable with basic maid training. | **Rejection Rate < 5%**. | Sorting labor > 20% of revenue (unprofitable). |
| **Legal** | "License Bridge" (Rental Partner) satisfies police/district checks. | **0 Fines / Stoppages** in 90 days. | Truck impounded or operations halted. |

## 2. Pilot Cluster: Phra Khanong / On Nut Loop
*   **Target:** 3 Buildings (approx. 1,200 units total).
*   **Route:** Sukhumvit 71 -> 77 -> Rama 4.
*   **Duration:** Month 1–3.

## 3. Validation Schedule

### Month 1: The "Dry Run"
*   [ ] **Week 1:** Site Surveys (Truck height check) for 5 candidates.
*   [ ] **Week 2:** Sign 1 "Beta Partner" (discounted 50% for first month in exchange for data).
*   [ ] **Week 3:** Fleet Rental Setup (Siam Rajathanee) - 1 Month trial.
*   [ ] **Week 4:** Bin deployment + Maid Training Session.

### Month 2: Service Launch
*   [ ] **Ops:** Daily weight logging + "Time-on-Site" tracking.
*   [ ] **QA:** Visual audit of every bin tip (photos tracked).
*   [ ] **Finance:** Issue first invoice (Advance Billing test).

### Month 3: The "Investor Packet"
*   [ ] **Churn Test:** Ask Beta Partner to renew at full price.
*   [ ] **Data Pack:** Compile "Diversion Report" and case study.
*   [ ] **Unit Economics:** Calculate actual *Cost per Pickup* vs. Model.

## 4. Success Criteria (Go/No-Go)
*   **GO:** 2 Paid Contracts + Gross Margin > 40% + Maid compliance high.
*   **PIVOT:** Clients love service but refuse price -> Pivot to "Aggregator" model (sell consolidated material only, drop service fee).
*   **STOP:** Regulatory shutdown or Operations cost > Revenue.

## 5. Required Evidence (for Evidence Register)
*   [ ] Signed Service Agreement (Redacted).
*   [ ] Monthly Invoice + Proof of Payment.
*   [ ] Driver Logbook (Time/Km).
*   [ ] Disposal/Sale Receipts (Material Revenue).
