# Impact Monetization (Carbon/Plastic Credits) — Positioning Memo (Draft)

## 1. Decision
- **Near-term stance (recommended):** Do **not** include carbon/plastic credit revenue in base projections.
- **Why:** Avoid credibility risk; MRV + registry + buyer pipeline are non-trivial and require proof.

## 2. Where impact appears in the product (allowed now)
- Building-level diversion reporting (kg by material).
- CO2e reporting using clearly documented factors (benchmark factors, not audited LCA).

## 3. Optional staged pathway (only if requested by investor/brand)
- Stage 1: Measurement (pilot), chain-of-custody, data QA.
- Stage 2: Choose standard/registry and define MRV requirements.
- Stage 3: Secure buyer/offtake for credits.

## 4. Close criteria
- Update BM-02 and BM-06 answers to reference this memo.
- If pursuing credits, add a dedicated evidence brief and archive the chosen standard/registry docs.
