# Pitch Deck Outline (10 Slides)

## Slide 1: Title
**Recycling25**
*The Professional Compliance Solution for Bangkok Condominiums.*

## Slide 2: The Problem (It's about Money & Law)
*   **BMA Regulation:** "No Mixed Waste" policy splits fees: 20 THB (sorted) vs 60 THB (mixed). <!-- claim:CLAIM-BMA-FEE-001 -->
*   **The Cost:** A 400-unit condo wastes ~190,000 THB/year in excess fees.
*   **The Pain:** Juristic Managers have no system to comply.

## Slide 3: The Solution
*   **Turn-Key Service:** Bins, Pickups, Reporting.
*   **Compliance:** We provide the "Audit Trail" (Chain of Custody) the BMA requires.
*   **Simplicity:** Weekly reliable service. No mess.

## Slide 4: Business Model (Fee-First)
*   **We charge for Service, not just Plastic.**
*   **Fee:** 90 THB / unit / month. <!-- claim:CLAIM-FEE-UNIT-001 -->
*   **Recurring Revenue:** Predictable, contracted cash flow.
*   **Upside:** Material sales are a bonus, not the baseline.

## Slide 5: Market Opportunity

*   **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** Zone A (300 buildings) = 11M THB/month opportunity.
