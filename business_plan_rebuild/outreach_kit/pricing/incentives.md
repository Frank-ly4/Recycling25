# Incentive Catalog (Residents / Juristic / Staff)

**Status:** Draft (desk-ready)  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Owner:** Sales / Commercial

## 1) Purpose
Define incentives that increase pilot sign-ups, resident participation, and operational compliance, without creating fraud risk or margin leakage.

## 2) Incentive rules (global)
- **Eligibility**: incentives apply only to enrolled pilot buildings with an executed pilot SLA/LOI and a defined measurement method.
- **Measurement source**: weights from on-site scale logs or processor weighbridge receipts; photos only as secondary proof.
- **Cap & budget**: every incentive has a monthly cap per building; incentives must be budgeted per pilot.
- **Anti-fraud**: no cash paid without objective verification (weights/attendance logs).
- **Payment method**: (a) invoice credit to juristic account, or (b) in-kind items (bins, signage), or (c) reporting/recognition.

## 6) Notes (pricing and contract linkage)
- Incentives must be reflected in the pilot SLA schedule (if monetary), or delivered as invoice credits/in-kind to reduce cash handling risk.
- Any cash incentive is administered by the building (juristic) where possible; Recycling25 provides the calculation and proof pack.
