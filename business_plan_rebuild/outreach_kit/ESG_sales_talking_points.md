# ESG Sales Talking Points: The "Zero Waste" Pivot

**Target Audience:** Juristic Managers & Condo Committees (under Sansiri, AP, Noble management).
**Objective:** Shift the conversation from "Cost" to "Corporate Compliance".

## 1. The "HQ Mandate" Hook
*   **Context:** Major developers have set aggressive public targets. Juristic Managers are under pressure to report data.
*   **Sansiri:** *"Waste to Worth"* initiative targets **Zero Waste to Landfill by 2025**.
*   **AP Thailand:** *"Green Lifestyles"* targets significantly reduced construction and household waste.

**The Script:**
> "Khun [Manager Name], I know HQ is asking for your 'Waste Diversion' numbers for the 2025 Sustainability Report. Currently, the municipality gives you zero data.
>
> **Recycling25 gives you the Audit Trail.** Every month, we send you a PDF certifying exactly how many kgs of plastic you diverted from landfill. You just forward this to HQ and you're compliant."

## 2. The "Audit Trail" Value Prop
*   **Problem:** Informal salengs pay cash but provide no receipts, no weights, and no chain of custody.
*   **Solution:** We provide a **Digital Weighing Log**.
*   **Talking Point:** "We are not just a collector; we are your **ESG Data Partner**. The 90 THB fee isn't for the trash; it's for the *Report* that keeps you safe with HQ."

## 3. Overcoming the "Free" Objection
*   **Objection:** "But the Saleng takes it for free!"
*   **Rebuttal:** "The Saleng takes the 'Easy Value' (cans/bottles) and leaves the low-value plastic that clogs your bins. And they give you no data.
*   **The Closer:** "Does the Saleng help you hit the Sansiri Net Zero target? We do."

## 4. The "Certificate" Incentive
*   **Offer:** Annual "Green Building Certificate" (framed) for the lobby.
*   **Benefit:** Increases property value perception for residents/tenants.
