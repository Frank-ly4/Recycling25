# Legal & Compliance Framework

## 1. Regulatory Permits (Thailand)

### 1.1. Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA)
*   **Permit Type:** "License for Operation of Business Detrimental to Health" (กิจการที่เป็นอันตรายต่อสุขภาพ).
*   **Authority:** Public Health Act B.E. 2535 (1992), Section 31. <!-- claim:CLAIM-BMA-LICENSE-001 -->
*   **Specific Category:** Type 9 (Business related to hygiene or environment) - Waste Collection/Transport.
*   **Application Form:** **Form Sor.Por. 1 (แบบ สภ.1)**. <!-- claim:CLAIM-BMA-LICENSE-001 -->
*   **Filing Location:** Environmental Sanitation Section (ฝ่ายสิ่งแวดล้อมและสุขาภิบาล) at the local District Office (Khet) where the warehouse is located.
*   **Estimated Fee:** ~5,000 - 10,000 THB/year (varies by facility size/horsepower).
*   **Requirement:** Approved facility inspection (sanitation, ventilation, pest control).
*   **Status:** **MANDATORY** before commercial operation.

### 1.2. Department of Land Transport (DLT)
*   **Vehicle Registration:** **Commercial Transport License (Yellow Plate 70-xxxx)**. <!-- claim:CLAIM-DLT-YELLOW-001 -->
    *   *Authority:* Land Transport Act B.E. 2522 (1979).
    *   *Rationale:* Charging a service fee may be treated as transport-for-hire and trigger DLT registration/operator requirements. **ASSUMPTION—VALIDATE** pending explicit DLT guidance on plate class and operator licensing for this specific service model. <!-- claim:CLAIM-DLT-YELLOW-001 -->
*   **Driver License:** Type 2 (Commercial) Driving License (ใบขับขี่ บ.2) required for all drivers.
*   **Constraint:** Yellow plate registration requires the company to have a transport permit license number (significant paperwork hurdle).
*   **Mitigation:** **Lease via Licensed Partner** (License Bridge). The lessor (e.g., Siam Rajathanee) holds the operator license and plates; we operate as the client.

### 1.3. Factory Act (Department of Industrial Works)
*   **Threshold:** Machinery < 50 HP and < 50 workers.
*   **Plan:** Keep sorting facility below these thresholds to avoid full Factory License (Ror.Ngor.4) requirements.
*   **Equipment Cap:** Use vertical balers (typically 5-10 HP) to stay safely under the 50 HP aggregate limit.

## 2. Tax & Revenue Code Compliance
*   **VAT (Value Added Tax):**
    *   *Threshold:* Mandatory registration if revenue > 1.8M THB/year (Revenue Code Sec. 81/1). <!-- claim:CLAIM-VAT-THRESH-001 -->
    *   *Rate:* 7%.
    *   *Implication:* All contracts must be VAT-exclusive.
*   **Withholding Tax (WHT):**
    *   *Service Income:* 3% WHT (Revenue Code Sec. 3 Tre). <!-- claim:CLAIM-WHT-SVC-001 -->
    *   *Transport Income:* 1% WHT (if registered as transport operator).
    *   *Cash Flow:* We assume 3% deduction on receipts.

## 3. Corporate Structure & Labor
*   **Entity:** Thai Limited Company (51% Thai owned) to avoid Foreign Business Act restrictions on service businesses (List 3).
*   **Social Security:** Mandatory registration for all full-time employees (Driver, Loader, Sorter) under Section 33.
*   **Safety (OSHA equivalent):** Provision of PPE (gloves, masks, boots) and H&S training logs required by Labor Protection Act.

## 4. Condo Service Agreements
*   **Contract Type:** B2B Service Agreement (Company to Juristic Person).
*   **Key Clauses:**
    *   **Scope:** Defined recyclables (PET, HDPE, Cans, etc.).
    *   **Exclusions:** Hazardous waste, wet waste, construction debris.
    *   **Indemnity:** Provider not liable for pre-existing bin room conditions; Client liable for hazardous items placed in bins.
    *   **Term:** 12 months (auto-renew).
    *   **Payment:** Net 15 or Net 30 days.

## 5. Data Privacy (PDPA)
*   **Scope:** Juristic contact details (B2B data) are generally exempt, but any **Resident Data** (if app/QR used) falls under PDPA.
*   **Policy:** "Data Minimization" — collect only what is needed for service verification (timestamp, weight, location). Avoid collecting resident names/room numbers unless necessary for specific incentive programs.

## 6. Risk of Non-Compliance
*   **BMA Fine:** Up to 50,000 THB and/or imprisonment for operating without a license.
*   **DLT Fine:** Impounding of vehicle if used commercially without proper registration.
*   **Contractual:** Immediate termination if insurance or permits lapse.
