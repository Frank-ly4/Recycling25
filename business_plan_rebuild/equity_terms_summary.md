# Equity Round — Terms Summary (Draft)

**Company:** Recycling25 Co., Ltd.

## 1. Status
- **Current status:** DRAFT — all economic and governance terms populated; subject to negotiation.
- **Purpose:** Provide a clear equity alternative to the current revenue-share model (see `investor_relations.md`).

## 2. Proposed Security
- **Type:** Ordinary Shares (simpler structure for seed stage; avoids complexity of preferred share class under Thai law)
- **Alternative:** Convertible note or SAFE if investor prefers (defers valuation conversation)

## 3. Economics
- **Pre-money valuation:** 4,000,000 - 6,000,000 THB
  - **Rationale:** 2.67x - 4x on 1.5M raise; seed-stage early-traction multiplier
  - **Benchmark:** Pre-revenue/pilot-stage Thai startups typically 2-5x raise amount
- **Raise amount:** 1,500,000 THB (Seed Tranche)
- **Post-money valuation:** 5,500,000 - 7,500,000 THB
- **Investor ownership:** ~20-27% post-money (before option pool)
- **Option pool:** 12% post-money (investor bears proportional dilution; see `governance.md` Section 6)

## 4. Investor Rights (baseline)
- **Liquidation preference:** 1x non-participating
  - Investor receives 1x investment back before common distribution, then participates pro-rata as common
  - Standard seed-stage structure; protects downside without excessive founder dilution
- **Anti-dilution:** Broad-based weighted average (BWAA)
  - Protects investor from significant down-rounds
  - Founder-friendly: less dilutive than full-ratchet
- **Pro-rata rights:** Yes, for investors holding ≥15% post-money
  - Allows investor to maintain ownership percentage in future rounds
  - Typical threshold: 10-20% minimum ownership
- **Information rights:**
  - **Monthly:** Flash report (revenue, units, cash balance, key metrics) within 15 days of month-end
  - **Quarterly:** Full P&L, balance sheet, cash flow statement within 30 days of quarter-end
  - **Annual:** Audited financials (if available) or reviewed statements within 120 days of year-end
  - **Annual budget:** Provided 30 days before fiscal year start
- **Reserved matters:** Founder/board approval required for:
  - Issuance of new equity or convertible instruments
  - Debt incurrence >500,000 THB
  - Sale of company or >50% of assets (M&A)
  - Annual budget approval
  - Change in business model or pivot
  - Related-party transactions >100,000 THB
  - Dissolution or bankruptcy filing

## 5. Governance
- **Board composition:** 2 founders + 1 investor observer (non-voting)
  - Investor observer attends board meetings, receives board materials, but does not vote
  - Investor gains voting board seat at Series A (if ≥20% ownership)
- **Board meeting cadence:** Monthly during pilot phase (months 1-12); quarterly thereafter
- **Founder vesting:** 4-year with 1-year cliff, monthly after cliff
  - Aligns with employee vesting (see `governance.md` Section 6)
  - Single-trigger 50% acceleration on exit; double-trigger for involuntary termination post-exit
- **Founder voting:** Unanimous founder approval required for reserved matters until Series A

## 6. Transfer / Thai law considerations
- **Foreign ownership constraints:**
  - **Foreign Business Act (List 3):** Service businesses require 51% Thai ownership unless exempted via BOI promotion
  - **Implication:** If investor is foreign person/entity, company must maintain ≥51% Thai shareholder majority OR obtain BOI promotion (which exempts from Foreign Business Act)
  - **Our structure:** Two options:
    1. **Thai-majority:** Ensure founders + Thai investors maintain >51% (foreign investor capped at 49%)
    2. **BOI route:** Apply for BOI promotion under Activity 5.1 (recycling/waste treatment) to allow 100% foreign ownership (see `audits/boi_decision_memo.md` and `legal_compliance.md` Section 7)
  - **Preferred:** Revenue-share structure (see `investor_relations.md`) avoids this issue entirely (not equity, not subject to Foreign Business Act)
- **Transfer restrictions:** Standard ROFR, drag-along, tag-along (see `governance.md` Section 8 "Standard Investor Rights Clauses")
- **Shareholder agreement:** Separate SHA required to document these terms (counsel-drafted)

## 7. Close criteria
- Replace all TBDs with agreed terms.
- Ensure cap table and dilution math reconcile (`cap_table.md`, `dilution_model.md`).
