# Market Analysis: Bangkok Condominium Recycling

## 1. Executive Overview
Bangkok's waste management landscape is undergoing a regulatory shift. The "No Mixed Waste" initiative by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) creates a direct financial incentive for condominiums to separate waste.
*   **The Lever:** **BMA Ordinance on Waste Disposal (2019 Amendment)** sets a compliant rate of 20 THB/month vs. a non-compliant rate of 60 THB/month per unit. <!-- claim:CLAIM-BMA-FEE-001 -->
*   **The Math:** A 400-unit building faces a 24,000 THB/month (288k/year) liability if they fail to separate. This pays for 66% of our service fee immediately.

## 2. Target Market Segment (ICP)
Our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is the "Mid-to-Large Scale Condominium" in high-density districts (Zone A).

*   **Building Size:** 300–600 units (optimal for route density and volume).
*   **Location:** Sukhumvit (Wattana/Khlong Toei) - Specifically the Phra Khanong-On Nut cluster.
*   **Decision Maker:** Juristic Person Manager (pain point: operational hassle) and Condo Committee (pain point: cost/compliance).

## 4. Competitor Landscape

| Competitor Type | Examples | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Informal Sector** | Saleng / Junk Shops | Low/No cost, cash for high-value items. | Unreliable, no data/reporting, pickers only take high-value items, messy. | **Professionalism, Compliance Data, Reliability.** |
| **Free Platforms** | Waste Buy, Recycoex | Digital interface, sometimes free. | Variable service levels, often rely on 3rd party logistics, lack robust building-level reporting. | **Turn-key Service, SLA guarantees, Building-wide solution.** |
| **Traditional Waste** | Private Haulers | High capacity. | Focus on general waste, poor sorting, landfill-centric. | **Specialization in Recyclables, Circular Economy focus.** |

## 5. Strategic Positioning
We position not as a "garbage collector," but as a **"Compliance & Sustainability Service."**
*   **Revenue Model:** Fee-for-service (80–100 THB/unit/month).
*   **Value Prop:** We solve the BMA compliance headache and provide the ESG data juristic managers need to keep their jobs and satisfy committees.
*   **Saleng Integration:** We collaborate with local saleng for last-mile support where efficient, bringing them into the formal fold rather than displacing them, enhancing community relations.
