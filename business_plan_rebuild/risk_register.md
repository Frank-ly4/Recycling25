# Risk Register

## 1. Strategic Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price War:** Competitors undercut 90 THB fee. | High | High | Emphasize "Compliance Safety" & Data. Offer "Lite" tier (less freq) to match price. | Sales |

| **Material Price Crash:** PET drops <10 THB/kg. | Med | Low | **Fees-First Model** insulates P&L. Revenue comes from service, not trading. | Finance |
