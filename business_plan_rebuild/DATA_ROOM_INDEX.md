## Notes
- Use `evidence/` for source documents (PDFs, screenshots, quotes). Keep redacted versions here; store unredacted originals in a controlled-access vault and reference them by a pointer file if needed.
- The canonical “what’s still open + owners + close criteria” tracker remains `audits/DD_GAP_REGISTER_151225.md`.
