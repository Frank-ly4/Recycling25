## 3. Risk Buffers
1.  **Fees-First Model:** We do not rely on plastic trading margins to pay back investors. 100% of repayment comes from contracted service fees.
2.  **Cash Reserve:** The plan maintains a minimum cash balance of >500k THB throughout Year 1 (assuming 1.5M starting), providing resilience against payment delays.
3.  **Asset Backing:** Bins and equipment retain liquidation value (~300k).

## 4. Reporting Cadence
*   **Monthly:** "Flash Report" (Revenue, Units, Cash Balance).
*   **Quarterly:** Full P&L + Repayment Transfer.
*   **Annual:** Audit & Strategy Review.
