# FINAL PRODUCT SCOPE (Repository Rule)

**Final product directory:** `business_plan_rebuild/`

This repository is being refactored so that `business_plan_rebuild/` is the **only actively maintained, investor/operator-facing deliverable**. Everything else is historical reference and will be moved under `archived_repo_material/`.

## 1) Canonical sources (single truth)
- **Financial truth:** `business_plan_rebuild/financials/model_inputs.json` is the single source of truth for drivers. Outputs are generated by `business_plan_rebuild/financials/generate_model.py` into `projections.json`, `cashflow.json`, and `waterfall.json`.
- **Contracts (canonical templates):**
  - `business_plan_rebuild/outreach_kit/service_agreement_12m.md`
  - `business_plan_rebuild/outreach_kit/pilot_SLA.md`
- **Evidence tracking:** `business_plan_rebuild/evidence_register.json` + `business_plan_rebuild/evidence/`

## 2) Linking policy (minimize links)
- Core narrative documents should be readable **without navigating** to appendices.
- Links are allowed for:
  - financial artifacts (`financials/*`)
  - evidence artifacts (`evidence/*`)
  - canonical templates (`outreach_kit/*`, `pdpa/*`)
- Do not introduce links from `business_plan_rebuild/` to files outside the folder.

## 3) Appendices policy (supporting only)
`business_plan_rebuild/appendices/` is for supporting material and evidence only. If content is required to understand execution, it should be **copied/embedded** into the relevant core document and the appendix copy marked reference-only.

## 4) Archived materials
All non-final folders/files will be moved under `archived_repo_material/` to preserve history within the same git repo while keeping the working tree clean.
