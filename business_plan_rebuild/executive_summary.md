# Executive Summary

## 1. The Opportunity
Bangkok's waste management sector is at a tipping point. New BMA regulations (Ordinance on Waste Disposal) penalize mixed waste disposal (60 THB/unit) while incentivizing separation (20 THB/unit). <!-- claim:CLAIM-BMA-FEE-001 --> For a typical 400-unit condominium, this compliance gap represents a ~190,000 THB annual liability. Yet, Juristic Managers lack the infrastructure, labor, and expertise to manage effective recycling programs.

## 2. The Solution
**Recycling25** provides a professional, turn-key recycling service for condominiums. We don't just collect plastic; we manage compliance.
*   **Service:** Scheduled weekly collection of PET, HDPE, and other recyclables.
*   **Compliance:** Monthly ESG reports and "Chain of Custody" documentation to satisfy BMA requirements and Developer (Sansiri/AP) Net Zero goals. <!-- claim:CLAIM-ESG-DEV-001 -->
*   **Operations:** Uniformed staff, standardized bins, and reliable logistics integration.

## 3. Business Model: Fee-First Service
Unlike volatile trading-based models, we operate on a **Service Fee** basis to ensure predictable cash flow.
*   **Fee:** 80–100 THB per unit / month. <!-- claim:CLAIM-FEE-UNIT-001 -->
*   **Revenue:** A 400-unit building generates ~36,000 THB/month in recurring revenue.
*   **Upside:** Material sales (PET/HDPE) provide bonus margin but are not required for core profitability.

## 4. Financial Targets
*   **Profitability:** Base case reaches **positive net income by Month 12** (at ~9 buildings) and **≥60,000 THB/month net income by Month 15** (at ~12 buildings). <!-- claim:CLAIM-SCALE-001 -->
*   **Scale Required:** ~12 buildings (≈4,800 units at 400 units/building) in the Phra Khanong Cluster to exceed ≥60k net income/month in the current base case. <!-- claim:CLAIM-SCALE-001 -->
*   **Unit Economics:** High contribution margin per building via route clustering (5km radius).

## 5. Investment Ask & Returns
*   **Capital Ask:** 1.5M THB (Seed Tranche 1) to fund Yellow Plate vehicle compliance, warehouse deposit, and 6-month runway.
*   **Use of Funds:** Fleet & Logistics (33%), Facility/Equipment (30%), Working Capital (37%).
*   **ROI:** Under the current revenue-share waterfall, the **1.5x cap is reached at Month 54 (~4.5 years)**. <!-- claim:CLAIM-ROI-001 -->
*   **Risk Mitigation:** "Fees-first" model insulates against plastic price crashes. Staged funding tranches based on signed LOIs.

## 6. Roadmap
*   **Month 1-3:** Validation Sprint & Pilot (Phra Khanong-On Nut Loop).
*   **Month 4-6:** Operational hardening & Seed Funding.
*   **Month 7-12:** Scale to 9 buildings (reach break-even / small positive net income in base case).
*   **Month 13-15:** Scale to ~12 buildings (≥60k/month net income in base case).
*   **Month 12+:** Expansion to next Zone A cluster (Thong Lo / Ekkamai).
