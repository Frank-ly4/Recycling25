# Pricing Notes (How to Use `pricing_catalog.csv`)

Canonical pricing ladder: `appendices/finance/pricing_catalog.csv`

## Why tiers exist
- **Buyer reality:** Condos and developer portfolios often prefer a building-level fee and will compare against “free” informal collectors.
- **Our defense:** tiers let us hold a floor price while offering levers (frequency, SLA, reporting depth) to match budget codes.

## Recommended usage in Bangkok Zone A
- Start pilots with a clear path to **Standard** pricing after 30–60 days (see `outreach_kit/pilot_SLA.md`).
- Use **Portfolio** packages for developer/FM-managed clusters to reduce payment-delay and speed ramp.
- If facing price pressure, prefer reducing frequency/reporting depth rather than cutting below a sustainable floor.

## Where this connects
- Risk register: pricing war and pricing model mismatch (`risk_register.md`).
- Investor defense: price sensitivity (`financials/sensitivity_analysis.md`).
