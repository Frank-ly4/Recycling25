# Fuel Price Logging SOP (Weekly)

Purpose: Maintain a weekly record of diesel prices to inform sensitivity analysis and surcharges.

## Cadence
- Every Friday by 12:00 local time.

## Steps
1. Open `appendices/research_briefs/fuel/diesel_price_log.csv`.
2. Record: date (YYYY-MM-DD), station_name, district, price_thb_per_litre, source_url, captured_by.
3. Save the source (screenshot/PDF) in `appendices/research_briefs/fuel/` with the same date.
4. Notify finance if weekly average exceeds surcharge threshold.

## QA
- Supervisor samples one entry per month; verify source file and accuracy.

## Notes
- Use official sources where possible (vendor websites, station photos).
- Keep a consistent station benchmark when feasible to reduce variance.
