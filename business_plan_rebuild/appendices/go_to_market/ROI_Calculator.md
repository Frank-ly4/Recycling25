# ROI Calculator — Building-Level Billing (Bangkok Condos)

Purpose: Provide a clear, conservative ROI view for juristic boards/FM buyers versus doing nothing or relying on informal/free options. Use as a section in proposals and in board briefings.

## Inputs
- Units billed (u)
- Price per unit THB (p)
- Compliance impact on BMA waste fees (Δfee): differential between non-compliant mixed-waste rate and compliant sorted rate (see plan Section 2: Problem/Why Now)
- Compliance achievement rate (c, 0–1)
- Operations savings/value (s): reduced staff time/complaints (optional)
- Optional adders (a): sponsorship/EPR/material sales (exclude in conservative case)

## Formulas
- Monthly service fee = u × p
- Estimated avoided BMA fees = u × Δfee × c
- Conservative ROI = (avoided BMA fees + s) − monthly service fee
- Payback view (pilot to contract) = months to net-positive under conservative inputs

## Example (Conservative)
- u = 400 units; p = 90 THB; Δfee = 40 THB; c = 0.7; s = 0
- Service fee = 36,000 THB
- Avoided BMA fees ≈ 400 × 40 × 0.7 = 11,200 THB
- ROI (conservative) = 11,200 − 36,000 = −24,800 THB (pure-fee view)

Interpretation: Pure BMA-fee avoidance does not fully offset service fees in early months. The business case rests on reliability, compliance assurance, resident experience, cleanliness, and portfolio ESG/reporting value. Adders (sponsorship/material credits) can improve ROI but are excluded from base case.

## Presentation
Include this one-slide table in proposals:

| Input | Value |
|---|---|
| Units billed (u) | 400 |
| Price per unit (p) | 90 THB |
| Δfee (BMA) | 40 THB |
| Compliance rate (c) | 0.7 |
| Monthly service fee | 36,000 THB |
| Avoided BMA fees | 11,200 THB |
| Conservative ROI | −24,800 THB |

Notes:
- Emphasize compliance-grade reporting, reliability, and reduced staff burden.
- Offer tiered packages and performance credits to address buyer risk.
- Provide an upside case with material revenues only if processor MOUs exist.
