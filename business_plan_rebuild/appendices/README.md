# Appendices (Execution Pack)

This folder exists so `business_plan_rebuild/` can be shared as a **standalone data room**.

## What is canonical?
- **Financial “truth”**: `business_plan_rebuild/financials/model_inputs.json` and its generated outputs (`projections.json`, `cashflow.json`, `waterfall.json`). Any other finance artifacts are supporting/legacy only.
- **Commercial templates**: `business_plan_rebuild/outreach_kit/service_agreement_12m.md` and `business_plan_rebuild/outreach_kit/pilot_SLA.md`.

## What is in appendices?
- `ops_sops/`: execution SOPs (collection, sorting, H&S, SLA measurement).
- `go_to_market/`: board/portfolio materials (pilot SLA reference copy, ROI calculator).
- `ops_playbooks/`: facility/hiring plans, fuel SOP, processor MOU template, informal sector integration.
- `finance/`: pricing ladder used for tiering and portfolio negotiation.
- `research_briefs/`: evidence briefs that justify assumptions (facility rent, wages, PDPA, fuel logs).
- `pilots/`: pilot rollout artifacts and KPI schema.
