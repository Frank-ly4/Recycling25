## Bangkok-Specific Considerations

### Location Factors
- **Traffic patterns**: Avoid facilities requiring peak-hour travel through major congestion points (Asok, Siam, Silom)
- **Flood risk**: Select locations with minimal historical flooding (avoid low-lying areas near canals)
- **Access restrictions**: Verify truck access hours (some areas restrict large vehicle movement during peak hours)
- **Source**: Bangkok Traffic and Transportation Department, Flood Risk Maps, 2024

### Regulatory Considerations
- **Zoning compliance**: Verify waste sorting is permitted in selected location
- **Environmental permits**: Check requirements for waste handling facility
- **Neighbor considerations**: Assess proximity to residential areas and potential complaints
- **Source**: Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, District Offices, 2025

### Climate Factors
- **Ventilation**: Ensure adequate airflow for sorting area (high temperatures increase odor issues)
- **Rain protection**: Covered loading/unloading area to operate during monsoon season
- **Pest control**: Regular pest control service to manage insects in tropical climate
- **Source**: Site visits to similar operations, July 2025

## Implementation Timeline

- Days 1-15: Facility search and shortlisting
- Days 15-30: Lease negotiation and signing
- Days 30-45: Basic renovations and setup
- Days 45-60: Equipment installation and testing

### Launch Phase (30 days)
- Days 1-15: Staff training in facility
- Days 15-30: Pilot operations with 1-2 buildings

### Scale Phase
- Months 2-3: Expand to 3-5 buildings
- Months 4-6: Expand to 6-8 buildings
- Months 7-12: Expand to 9-12 buildings

## Risk Mitigation

### Facility Risks
- **Lease termination**: Secure minimum 3-year lease with renewal options
- **Rent increases**: Cap annual increases at 5% in lease agreement
- **Space constraints**: Ensure lease allows for expansion or relocation to larger unit in same complex
- **Utility disruptions**: Install backup power for critical equipment

### Equipment Risks
- **Vehicle breakdown**: Establish relationship with backup vehicle rental service
- **Equipment failure**: Maintain spare parts inventory for critical components
- **Capacity limitations**: Design sorting process for flexible scaling with temporary labor

### Vendor Risks
- **Supplier reliability**: Qualify multiple vendors for critical supplies
- **Price volatility**: Establish price caps or adjustment formulas in contracts
- **Service quality**: Include performance metrics and penalties in service contracts
