# Competitive Landscape — Bangkok Condo Recyclables (Draft)

## Purpose
Support CL-02 (competitive benchmarking) with a defensible, category-based view suitable for angels.

## Competitor categories (how condos actually choose)

### 1) Informal sector (saleng / junk shops)
- **What they offer:** Cash for high-value fractions; opportunistic pickups.
- **Strengths:** Lowest cost; high neighborhood coverage; flexible.
- **Weaknesses (for condos):** No SLA, no receipts/invoices, no reporting/audit trail, inconsistent cleanliness.
- **Our wedge:** Compliance-grade reporting + professionalism + predictable service.

### 2) Digital pickup / marketplace platforms
- **What they offer:** App-mediated buyback; scheduling; sometimes “free.”
- **Strengths:** Convenience, some traceability.
- **Weaknesses:** Variable service quality; reliance on third-party logistics; often not building-wide operationally.
- **Our wedge:** Turn-key building program (bins + education + SLA + monthly reporting).

### 3) Traditional waste management / haulers
- **What they offer:** General waste collection, often landfill-oriented.
- **Strengths:** Capacity; existing contracts.
- **Weaknesses:** Mixed-waste incentives; limited separation/reporting.
- **Our wedge:** Specialization in source-separated recyclables + chain-of-custody.

### 4) Large recyclers / processors
- **What they offer:** Buy material; some may run collection partnerships.
- **Strengths:** Strong offtake; scale.
- **Weaknesses:** Not optimized for condo service experience.
- **Our wedge:** Service layer + aggregation + QA.

## What we still need to collect (to make this investor-grade)
- 5–10 competitor quotes/screenshots (pricing, terms) archived in `evidence/market/`.
- A simple comparison table:
  - target customer
  - pricing model
  - SLA
  - reporting
  - invoice/VAT capability
  - coverage areas

## Close criteria
- Add 3–5 named competitors per category with archived evidence.
- Update `INVESTOR_QA_151225.md` (CL-02) to cite this brief and evidence artifacts.
