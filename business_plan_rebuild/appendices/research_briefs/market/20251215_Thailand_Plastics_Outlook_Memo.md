# Thailand Plastics Outlook (5–10 years) — Investor Memo (Draft)

## Purpose
Support MO-08 / MT-05 with a short, citation-driven outlook and the implications for our model.

## Current benchmark anchors (already archived)
- Bangkok baseline recycling estimate and supply-chain constraints: `evidence/market/20251215_circulate_th_selected_cities_plastic_recycling_supply_chains.pdf`.
- Thailand national plastic waste baseline: `evidence/market/20251215_usasean_plastics_biannual_report_2023.pdf`.
- Regulatory trend: Thailand EPR progression (Phase II 2023–2027): `evidence/policy/20251215_eria_thailand_epr_legal_framework.html`.

## Working theses (to be evidenced)
1. **Regulatory tightening + reporting pressure increases willingness-to-pay** for compliant, auditable recycling services.
2. **Commodity volatility persists** (PET and energy); our fees-first model reduces dependence.
3. **Traceability becomes more valuable** as EPR and brand commitments mature.

## Implications for Recycling25
- **Pricing floor:** defend with compliance/reporting value (not commodity value).
- **Offtake strategy:** keep multiple buyers; standardize specs to reduce rejection.
- **Product roadmap:** invest in measurement/reporting early; avoid resident-level data unless demanded.

## Gaps to close
- Add 2–3 additional sources:
  - PET/resin price index or Thailand PET bale market proxy.
  - Brand recycled-content commitments (regional) relevant to demand.
  - Government policy docs on packaging/EPR implementation detail.

## Close criteria
- Update MO-08 and MT-05 answers to cite this memo + the source artifacts.
- Add archived evidence files for the additional sources.
