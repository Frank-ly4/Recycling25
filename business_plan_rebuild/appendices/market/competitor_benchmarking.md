# Competitor Benchmarking — Pricing & Service Scope (CL-02)

**Status:** Draft (desk-ready)  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Owner:** Sales / Market Research

## 1) Purpose
Document competitor pricing models and service scope with dated proof notes to support differentiation claims.

## 2) Benchmark table (proof-backed)
| Competitor | Pricing model (observed) | Service scope (observed) | Target user | Proof (repo path) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WasteBuy Delivery | Buy-back pricing list (“Today’s Price”) + app-booked pickup (door-to-door) | Door-to-door recyclable pickup; accepts common streams (plastic/paper/metal/glass) | Consumers / households | `evidence/market/competitor_proofs/wastebuydelivery/20260102_capture_01.md` |
| Trash Lucky | Rewards/lottery program for recyclables (lucky draw tickets) | Program-based recycling participation (recyclables donation / collection program) | Consumers / participants | `evidence/market/competitor_proofs/trashlucky/20260102_capture_01.md` |
| RECYCOEX | Platform positioning for recyclable waste collection (online platform) | Platform-based recyclable collection (service positioning) | Consumers / collection requests | `evidence/market/competitor_proofs/recycoex/20260102_capture_01.md` |

## 3) Notes (how to interpret)
- This memo captures **public positioning** and **service model** claims. It does not verify service reliability, SLA performance, or actual contracted B2B terms.
- If we need condo/B2B comparables specifically, collect condo-facing pricing/terms from: (a) municipal/hauler providers, (b) condo recycling program vendors, and (c) processors offering collection partnerships.
