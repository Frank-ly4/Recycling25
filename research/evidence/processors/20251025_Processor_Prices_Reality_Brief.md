Date: 2025-10-24
Version: 1.0

## 1. Objective
To verify the potential secondary revenue stream from selling sorted recyclables by gathering public price lists from major Thai processors.

## 2. Desk Research Findings

| Material | Source | Grade | Price (THB/kg) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PET Plastic** | Wongpanit Price List (Oct 2025) | Clear, Grade A | 10 - 14 | Our primary target. Price is volatile but consistently valuable. |
| **HDPE Plastic** | Wongpanit Price List (Oct 2025) | Mixed Colors | 8 - 12 | Common from shampoo bottles, etc. |
| **Cardboard/Paper** | Wongpanit Price List (Oct 2025) | Mixed Office Paper / A4 | 3 - 5 | Lower value, but high volume. |
| **Cardboard** | Wongpanit Price List (Oct 2025) | Corrugated Boxes | 2 - 4 | |
| **Aluminum Cans** | Wongpanit Price List (Oct 2025) | UBC (Used Beverage Cans) | 45 - 55 | High value, but lower volume than plastics/paper. |
| **Mixed Metals** | Local Scrap Dealers (Market Rate) | Steel, etc. | 5 - 9 | |

## 3. Triangulation & Analysis

*   **Revenue per Building (Estimate):**
    *   Assume a 400-unit building generates 1,000 kg of mixed recyclables per month.
    *   A plausible mix: 40% Paper (400kg), 30% PET (300kg), 15% HDPE (150kg), 5% Cans (50kg), 10% Other.
    *   Estimated Revenue:
        *   Paper: 400kg * 3 THB/kg = 1,200 THB
        *   PET: 300kg * 12 THB/kg = 3,600 THB
        *   HDPE: 150kg * 10 THB/kg = 1,500 THB
        *   Cans: 50kg * 50 THB/kg = 2,500 THB
        *   **Total Estimated Monthly Revenue:** **~8,800 THB**

*   **Comparison to Financial Model:**
    *   Our financial model explicitly **excludes material sales revenue** for a conservative forecast.
    *   This research validates that decision. While the revenue is not insignificant (~8,800 THB per building could offset more than one employee's salary), it is highly dependent on resident participation, sorting quality, and volatile market prices.

## 4. Conclusion & Recommendation

The research confirms that revenue from recyclables is a viable secondary income stream but should not be relied upon as the primary driver of profitability.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **Maintain Conservative Forecast:** Continue to exclude material sales from the primary P&L in `finance/financial_model.csv`.
2.  **Add to Upside Scenario:** In `finance/assumptions.md`, add a section under "Sensitivity Analysis" for an "Upside Case" that includes material revenue. State that "Based on market prices (see `research/evidence/processors/20251025_Processor_Prices_Reality_Brief.md`), each building could generate an additional 5,000-9,000 THB/month in revenue, which can act as a buffer or accelerator for profitability."
3.  **Operational Focus:** This reinforces that the operational focus must be on delivering a high-quality service to secure the stable, recurring service fees.

This research provides a data-backed foundation for our conservative financial strategy and highlights a clear area for potential upside.
