Subject: Request: Waste Fee Schedule + “กิจการที่เป็นอันตรายต่อสุขภาพ” Permit Checklist (Condo Recycling)

To: [District Environment Division email], CC: [District Public Health Office email]

Dear [Title Name],

We are preparing a small-scale condo recycling pilot in [micro-cluster, e.g., Sukhumvit area] and seek written confirmation on:

1) Waste collection/disposal fees applicable to condominiums
- Current fee schedule (in Thai), including any reduced fees for registered separated waste and surcharges for mixed waste
- Whether the 20/60 THB household guidance also applies to condominiums or if separate rates apply
- How buildings are invoiced (monthly, by district), and what constitutes “separated” under your policy

2) Permit requirements for collection/temporary storage/transport of recyclables
- Whether the activity falls under “กิจการที่เป็นอันตรายต่อสุขภาพ” and district permit issuance
- Required documents (company registration, SOPs, insurance, site plan, photos)
- Processing time, fees, and renewal terms

Pending items we will supply upon request: SOPs, PDPA policy, insurance certificates, equipment spec.

Please reply with the fee table, permit checklist, and contact person for follow-up.
