Dear Officer,

We request a written pre‑screen on BOI eligibility for:

A) Service model: collection/aggregation/sorting of recyclables from condominiums (low machinery)
B) Investment model: installing a small recycling line (e.g., baler + washing/grinding) with defined capex

Please advise which activity codes (if any) apply, minimum requirements, tax incentives, and documentation for an application. A short email response is sufficient at this stage.
