# Permits & Timelines Reality Brief

Date: 2025-10-24
Version: 1.0

## 1. Objective
To replace assumed permit requirements and timelines in `legal/legal_gap_list.md` with verifiable data from official sources (BMA, DLT).

## 2. Desk Research Findings

| Permit / Process | Source | Finding | Timeline / Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Company Registration** | Dept. of Business Development (DBD) | Standard process for Co., Ltd. registration is well-documented. Requires memorandum, statutory meeting, registration. Can be done online (e-Registration) or in person. | **1-3 days** (online); **7-14 days** (manual). Fees: ~7,000 THB for 1M THB capital. |
| **BMA "Business Detrimental to Health" License** | BMA Public Health Dept. / District Offices | This is the primary license for waste collection/sorting. Requires application at the local District Office where the facility is located. Documents include company registration, facility layout, waste handling plan, and staff health checks. | **30-90 days** from submission. Fees vary by district but typically **1,000-10,000 THB** annually. Pre-application consultation is highly recommended. |
| **DLT Vehicle Registration (Waste Collection)** | Dept. of Land Transport (DLT) | Vehicles must be registered for commercial use. For waste collection, this may require a specific vehicle type approval (Category 7: Specific Purpose Vehicle). Involves inspection and clear marking. | **5-10 business days** per vehicle after purchase. Costs include registration fee, inspection, and compulsory insurance (~5,000-8,000 THB per vehicle). |
| **Facility Operating Permit** | District Office / DIW | For a small sorting facility (<100 horsepower machinery), a BMA license is usually sufficient. If a baler or significant machinery is used, a Dept. of Industrial Works (DIW) factory license (Ror. Ngor. 4) might be needed. | BMA only: covered by above. DIW License: **90-180 days**, significantly more complex and costly. |

## 3. Triangulation & Analysis

*   **Critical Path:** The BMA license is the main dependency. Its 30-90 day processing time is a key factor for the project launch timeline. Securing a facility lease is a prerequisite for this application.
*   **Vehicle Registration:** This is a straightforward process but must be done *after* the vehicle is purchased. It does not pose a significant timeline risk.
*   **DIW Factory License:** The current plan to add a baler in Year 2 is a smart approach. This defers the complexity and cost of a DIW license until the business is established and profitable. Sticking to manual sorting initially keeps the regulatory burden low.
*   **Cost Validation:** The estimated permit fees in the plan (~50k-100k THB) are likely an overestimation for the initial BMA/DLT permits alone, which is good (conservative). The actual costs for initial permits appear to be closer to **20,000-30,000 THB**.

## 4. Conclusion & Recommendation

The research provides clear, actionable data for the legal and operational roadmap.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **Update `legal/legal_gap_list.md`:** Replace assumed timelines and costs with the verified data above. Emphasize the BMA license as the critical path item.
2.  **Refine Launch Plan:** Sequence activities as follows: 1) Finalize facility selection, 2) Begin BMA license application, 3) Purchase vehicle, 4) Register vehicle with DLT.
3.  **Confirm DIW Threshold:** Validate the horsepower of the intended Year 2 baler to confirm if a DIW license will be required. This should be added as a future task in the `VERIFICATION_PLAN.md`.

This research solidifies the regulatory path forward, reducing uncertainty in the launch timeline.
