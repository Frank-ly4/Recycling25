# Strategic Questions to be Answered

*This is the master list of all critical, high-priority questions that must be answered to ensure the plan is viable and robust. These are the primary blockers to resolve.*

### **Financial & Business Model**
1.  **Financial Resilience:** How can the financial model be structured to guarantee stability even with fluctuating resident participation rates?
2.  **Willingness to Pay:** What is the actual, data-backed willingness of condo managers or residents to pay the proposed service fees? (Requires primary data beyond assumptions).
3.  **Fee Collection Process:** What is the exact mechanism for billing and collecting fees from juristic offices? What are the procedures for handling late payments or contract enforcement?
4.  **Grant Dependency:** If grants or sponsorships fail to materialize, what is the Plan B for funding initial operations and future expansion?

### **Legal & Regulatory**
1.  **Foreign Business License (FBL):** Are we eligible for a 100% foreign-owned FBL with fewer than 50 employees? What are the precise criteria, costs, documentation, and timelines for the application?
2.  **License Eligibility Gaps:** Which specific operational licenses (e.g., from the Department of Industrial Works) have requirements for employee count or machine horsepower that we currently do not meet? What are the workarounds?
3.  **Local Ordinances:** What are the specific local (BMA district-level) ordinances, "soft barriers," or unofficial requirements for waste collection and facility operation that are not covered in national law?
4.  **Data & Privacy:** If collecting resident-level data (even via QR codes), what are the specific requirements under Thai law (PDPA)? What data privacy policies and consent forms are needed?

### **Operations & Staffing**
1.  **Management Structure:** What are the detailed pros, cons, and cost implications of self-managing versus hiring a trusted Thai Operations Manager? At what salary point does hiring become viable?
2.  **Integration with Condo Staff:** What is the optimal model for integrating with existing cleaners/staff who collect recyclables for side income? Should it be collaboration, profit-sharing, or another model to create a win-win scenario and avoid conflict?
3.  **Labor Contingency:** What is the backup plan for labor shortages, high turnover, or poaching by competitors? Where is the backup labor pool?
4.  **Social Enterprise Structure:** What are the specific legal and business steps, requirements, and pros/cons of structuring as a Social Enterprise in Thailand?

### **Market & Competition**
1.  **Competitor Reaction:** How might the informal sector (*saleng*) or formal competitors react to our entry? What is the risk of price undercutting, sabotage, or negative lobbying with condo committees?
2.  **Sustainable Differentiation:** If competitors like Wongpanit or Trash Lucky pivot to offer a similar full-service model, what is our long-term, sustainable competitive advantage ("moat")?
