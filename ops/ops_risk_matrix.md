# Operations Risk Matrix - Bangkok Condo Recycling Service

## Risk Assessment Methodology

Each risk is evaluated based on:
- **Probability**: Likelihood of occurrence (1-5 scale)
  - 1: Very unlikely (<5% chance)
  - 2: Unlikely (5-25% chance)
  - 3: Possible (25-50% chance)
  - 4: Likely (50-75% chance)
  - 5: Very likely (>75% chance)

- **Impact**: Severity if risk occurs (1-5 scale)
  - 1: Minimal (minor inconvenience, no financial impact)
  - 2: Low (short disruption, <10,000 THB impact)
  - 3: Moderate (partial disruption, 10,000-50,000 THB impact)
  - 4: High (significant disruption, 50,000-200,000 THB impact)
  - 5: Severe (operations halted, >200,000 THB impact)

- **Risk Score**: Probability × Impact (1-25 scale)
  - 1-4: Low risk (monitor)
  - 5-10: Medium risk (develop mitigation plan)
  - 11-19: High risk (implement mitigation immediately)
  - 20-25: Critical risk (requires strategic response)
