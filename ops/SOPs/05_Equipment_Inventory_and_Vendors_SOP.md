## SOP â€” Equipment Inventory & Vendors

Purpose: Ensure replacement timelines and equipment promises are supported by stock levels and vendor SLAs.

Inventory policy
- Maintain minimum on-hand stock per building: bins (x%), lids (x%), signage sets (x%).
- Safety stock: 2-week average consumption; review monthly.

Vendors & SLAs
- Approved vendors with lead times and warranty terms recorded.
- Target replacement within 5 business days; if lead time exceeds, deploy interim equipment.

Workflow
- Incident logged -> stock check -> replacement order -> interim deployment (if needed) -> confirmation photo.

Records
- Keep purchase orders, delivery notes, and serials organized; review quarterly.
