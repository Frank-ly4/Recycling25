## SOP â€” SLA Measurement

Purpose: Define how SLA metrics are measured, recorded, and reported for contracts and pilots.

On-time definition
- On-time is arrival within the scheduled 4-hour window agreed in Schedule B.
- Timestamps captured via driver app and photo metadata; fallback: security sign-in logs.

Data capture
- Required fields: building, route/date, planned window, arrival/departure, reason codes (delay, access, weather), photo proofs.
- Overflow detection: on-site observation with photos; resident/manager photo reports tagged and verified.

Exclusions
- Force Majeure, access denial, hazardous conditions, or Client-caused delays are excluded from on-time calculations.

Escalation & backup
- If a pickup is missed, notify Client within 24h with a revised window; target backup within 48h subject to access and resources.
- Document root cause; apply corrective actions.

Reporting
- Monthly SLA report: on-time %, missed pickups, reasons, credits (if any).
- Audit trail preserved 12 months.
