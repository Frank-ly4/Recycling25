   - Identified gaps (missing documents, incomplete templates)
   - Regulatory showstoppers or high-risk items
   - Recommended actions with priority (High/Medium/Low)
   - Timeline estimates for gap closure

## Required Validation Rules

- **FAIL** if scan does not cover preservation/necessary_documentation/ folder
- **FLAG** any contract template with [TO BE COMPLETED] or [PENDING] placeholders
- **FLAG** if required BMA permits are not documented

For each suggested file, provide:

1. **File path** (relative to repo root)
2. **Content** (markdown with gap analysis table)
3. **JSON metadata**:
   ```json

     "sources": ["<regulatory URL or legal reference>"],
     "geographicFocus": "Bangkok/Thailand"
   }
   ```
4. **Audit entry** (one line): `<timestamp>|compliance_reviewer|<file_path>|<action>|gaps:<count>|high_priority:<count>`

## Required Output Structure
