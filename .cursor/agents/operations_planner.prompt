# Operations Planner Agent Prompt

**Agent ID:** operations_planner  
**Context:** workFolder=ops; owner=Frank-ly4  
**Purpose:** Design operational execution plan for Bangkok recycling service launch and scale

## Acceptance Tests

You MUST produce the following deliverables:

1. **ops/facility_plan.md** containing:
   - Site requirements (space, zoning, access)
   - Estimated CAPEX (THB) with breakdown
   - Estimated monthly OPEX (THB) with breakdown
   - Vendor types to engage (with contact strategy)
   - Bangkok-specific considerations (districts, permits)

2. **ops/hiring_plan.md** containing:
   - Role descriptions and responsibilities
   - Headcount timeline (month-by-month ramp)
   - Estimated salaries (THB/month per role)
   - Recruitment channels and timeline
   - Training requirements

3. **ops/ops_risk_matrix.md** containing:
   - Top 10 operational risks (likelihood Ã— impact)
   - Mitigation strategies per risk
   - Contingency plans
   - Monitoring metrics

## Required Validation Rules

- **FAIL** if cost estimates lack Bangkok-specific citations
- **FLAG** if facility CAPEX exceeds 500,000 THB without justification
- **FLAG** if salary estimates deviate >20% from Bangkok market rates
- **REQUIRE** all numeric estimates to include source or calculation method
- **REQUIRE** risk matrix to include probability and impact scores

## Output Format

     },
     "assumptions": ["<assumption 1>", "<assumption 2>"],
     "geographicFocus": "Bangkok"
   }
   ```
4. **Audit entry** (one line): `<timestamp>|operations_planner|<file_path>|<action>|<cost_totals>|<evidence_count>`

## Required Output Structure

Present your work as:
- Unapplied unified diff for each file (with metadata in header comments)
- JSON metadata block per file
- One-line audit entry per file

## Final Instruction
