# Sprawl & De-duplication — Review List

Generated: 2025-11-01

## Duplicates / Overlaps (Proposals)
- discovery_responses3.md / discovery_responses4.md / discovery_responses5.md
  - Proposal: Keep all as appendices; link from `docs/BusinessPlan/00_Business_Plan.md` (SWOT, 5-Forces, Feasibility).
- GoToMarket pricing analysis set (Pricing_Analysis_0907.md, Pricing_Stress_Test_0907.md, Pricing_Tiers_Model_Prompt.md, Pricing_Tiers_Results_0907.md)
  - Proposal: Keep as research appendix; unify canonical pricing in `finance/pricing_catalog.csv` and reference results briefly in plan.
- Constitutions: `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CONSTITUTION_INTEGRITY.md`, `memory/constitution.md`
  - Proposal: Keep both constitutions; cross-link them and reference memory as Spec-Kit runtime memo only.
- Contracts locations: `docs/GoToMarket/06_Service_Agreement_12m.md` and `preservation/necessary_documentation/11_Condo_Service_Agreement.md`
  - Proposal: Keep Go-To-Market version as client-facing; keep preservation as legal template; link both in plan.
- Orchestration docs: `docs/Cursor_Orchestration*.md`, `README-speckit.md`
  - Proposal: Keep; ensure not referenced in outward-facing artifacts; link from developer docs only.

## Stale Drafts / Legacy
- `archive/legacy_recycling_2025/**`, `archive/legacy_root/**`
  - Status: Historical; not part of current plan.
  - Proposal: Keep in archive; do not cite in core plan; cite only if historically relevant.
- `070925assessment`, `070925_action_plan.md`
  - Status: Pre-current-cycle materials.
  - Proposal: Move to `archive/` and link from `meta/change_log/` if needed.

## Orphaned / Clarify Ownership
- `BP_SUMMARY_20251024_v1.0.md`
  - Status: Standalone summary artifact.
  - Proposal: Link from `00_Business_Plan.md` as executive summary variant; maintain versioning.

## Next Actions
1. Link appendices from `00_Business_Plan.md` (SWOT/5-Forces/Feasibility).
2. Mark legacy pricing analyses as research appendices; ensure canonical pricing lives in `finance/pricing_catalog.csv`.
3. Add cross-links between `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CONSTITUTION_INTEGRITY.md`, and `memory/constitution.md`.
4. Move `070925assessment` and `070925_action_plan.md` to `archive/` (retain git history).
