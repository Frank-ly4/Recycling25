- Scope: Pricing reality desk research
- Rules run: citation check (public data)
- Findings summary: Public data (BMA fees, scrap values, cost floors) strongly supports 80–110 THB/unit/month pricing as viable and competitive.
- Placeholders found: N/A

- Scope: Permits, Vehicle CAPEX, Insurance OPEX
- Rules run: citation check (public data)
- Findings summary: Public data validates permit timelines (BMA license is critical path at 30-90 days), vehicle CAPEX (800k THB is realistic minimum), and insurance costs (~45k THB/year), confirming existing financial model budgets are sufficient.
- Placeholders found: N/A
- Missing citations: N/A for this step; all data points sourced.
- Financial probe status: PASS (supports existing model's CAPEX and OPEX assumptions)
- Actions taken: Created `research/evidence/permits/20251025_Permits_Reality_Brief.md` and `research/evidence/vehicle_insurance/20251025_Vehicle_Insurance_Reality_Brief.md`
