# Final QA Gate Report

Date: 2025-10-24
Version: 1.0

## 1. Objective
To perform a final quality assurance check on all business plan artifacts created and updated during the verification sprint, ensuring they meet the integrity and completeness standards set out in `CONSTITUTION_INTEGRITY.md`.

## 2. Scope
This check covers all files in `finance/`, `ops/`, `legal/`, `docs/BusinessPlan/`, and `config/`, plus all evidence briefs in `research/evidence/`.

## 3. Findings

| Check | Rule | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financial Sanity Probe** | `specify.json` rules | **PASS** | The updated `financial_model.csv` successfully projects a profit of â‰¥50,000 THB/month (achieved in Month 5) and all pricing tiers in `pricing_catalog.csv` maintain margins well above 10%. |
| **Citation Check** | Evidence-first principle | **PASS** | All key assumptions in `finance/assumptions.md`, `ops/hiring_plan.md`, `ops/facility_plan.md`, and `legal/legal_gap_list.md` now have citations pointing to the corresponding reality briefs in `research/evidence/`. |
| **Placeholder Scan** | No placeholders in customer-facing docs | **PASS** | Placeholders have been removed from templates like `06_Service_Agreement_12m.md` and `07_ESG_Report_Template.md` where they would be seen by customers. Internal legal templates still contain placeholders, which is correct. |
| **CO2e Factor Versioning** | Version critical factors principle | **PASS** | `config/co2e_factors.json` is now versioned (`20251025-INTL`), sourced, and cited correctly in the ESG template. |
| **Consistency Check** | Cross-functional alignment | **PASS** | Financials, operations, and legal timelines are now aligned. For example, the OPEX steps in the financial model match the hiring and facility milestones in the ops plans. |
| **Completeness Check** | `VERIFICATION_PLAN.md` | **PASS** | All high- and medium-priority verification items from the plan have been completed. The plan is now substantially backed by evidence. |

## 4. Conclusion & Recommendation

The business plan has successfully passed the final QA gate. The core artifacts are now robust, internally consistent, and backed by verifiable, cited evidence. The plan is watertight and ready for the next stage.

**Recommendation:**
1.  **Finalize Legal Templates:** The next major step is to work with legal counsel to turn the `preservation/necessary_documentation` templates into final, executable Thai-language contracts.
2.  **Execute Go-to-Market:** Begin outreach to juristic managers using the now-validated pricing and service model.
3.  **Archive Old Versions:** Consider archiving or removing older, un-cited versions of documents to ensure the latest, verified files are the single source of truth.

The project is ready to move from planning and verification into execution.
