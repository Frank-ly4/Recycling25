Licensing:

**1\. Business Registration and Structure**

* **Choose a Business Structure**: Decide on the appropriate legal entity, such as a Limited Company, which is common for foreign entrepreneurs. ​[pimlegal.com](https://www.pimlegal.com/2024/12/18/the-legal-checklist-for-starting-a-business-in-thailand/)  
* **Reserve a Company Name**: Ensure the chosen name is unique and complies with Thai regulations by reserving it through the Department of Business Development (DBD). ​[pimlegal.com+1benoit-partners.com+1](https://www.pimlegal.com/2024/12/18/the-legal-checklist-for-starting-a-business-in-thailand/)

**2\. Foreign Ownership and Licensing**

* **Foreign Business License (FBL)**: If you intend to have majority foreign ownership, apply for an FBL from the DBD, as certain business activities are restricted under the Foreign Business Act. ​[pimlegal.com](https://www.pimlegal.com/2024/12/18/the-legal-checklist-for-starting-a-business-in-thailand/)  
* **Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion**: Consider applying for BOI promotion to benefit from incentives like tax breaks and the ability to own 100% of the company. ​[benoit-partners.com](https://benoit-partners.com/starting-small-business-thailand/)

**3\. Environmental and Operational Licenses**

* **Operating License**: Obtain an operating license from the Department of Industrial Works if your machinery exceeds 50 horsepower or you employ more than 50 people. ​  
* **Environmental Compliance**: Conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) if required, and implement pollution control measures to adhere to environmental regulations. ​

**4\. Taxation and Financial Obligations**

* **Tax Identification Number (TIN)**: Register with the Revenue Department to obtain a TIN for tax purposes. ​[pimlegal.com](https://www.pimlegal.com/2024/12/18/the-legal-checklist-for-starting-a-business-in-thailand/)

**5\. Employment Regulations**

* **Work Permits and Visas**: Secure the appropriate visas and work permits for foreign employees, adhering to the ratio of Thai to foreign workers as stipulated by law. ​  
* **Social Security Registration**: Register your employees with the Social Security Office to comply with labor laws. ​

**6\. Commercial Vehicle Registration**
