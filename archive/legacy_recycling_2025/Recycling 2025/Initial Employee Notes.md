### **Standard Wages for Potential Employees**

Understanding the standard wages for roles within the recycling industry in Thailand is crucial for budgeting and ensuring competitive compensation:

* **Minimum Wage:** As of 2024, the minimum wage is 363THB/day or roughly 9,500THB/month  
  * Might be wise to assume 15,000THB per worker for our calculations for now, to account for overtime, benefits, and bonuses  
* **Base:** 1 driver and 1 assistant, perhaps roughly 25,000THB, slightly more for the driver perhaps  
  * Can use these guys as sorters for now  
  * Might be good for them if they can make 9,500 a month or so, but only have to work a few days a week, giving them a good salary and freetime

* **Recycling and Reclamation Workers:** The average annual salary is approximately THB 276,922, equating to about THB 133 per hour. This figure can vary based on experience and specific job responsibilities. ​[timeular.com+2erieri.com+2erieri.com+2](https://www.erieri.com/salary/job/recycling-and-reclamation-worker/thailand)

### **Training**:

*For instance, the **Thailand Waste Management & Recycling Academy** (mentioned by SecondMuse/Titus Loh) was set up to train and share knowledge among entrepreneurs and workers. We could engage with such programs to train our staff. Also, NGOs like **Less Plastic Thailand** (who sponsored condo recycling research)* 

- *SecondMuse collaborated with **impact-focused investment firm Seedstars** to launch the Thailand Waste Management & Recycling Academy (WMRA), with the aim of supporting innovative entrepreneurship in creating solutions and driving sustainable practices in waste management and recycling in the country.*  
- So, this could provide an option for training our staff, and moreover for connecting with other organizations and networking
