### **ðŸ’¡ How to Look for Blind Spots?**

ðŸš¨ **Assume Things Will Go Wrong** â†’ Build Preemptive Solutions

1. **Test Assumptions in Reverse**  
   * **What if condos refuse to pay?**  
     * Are they willing to sign a long-term contract?  
     * Would they pay **only if it lowers their general waste fee**?  
   * **What if residents donâ€™t separate recyclables?**  
     * Do you need an on-site staff member to monitor?  
     * Will janitors contaminate bins to resell for themselves?  
2. **Look for Unaccounted Costs**  
   * Fuel & truck maintenance **in year 2-3**â€”not just startup costs.  
   * Employee retention costs (turnover, training).  
   * Storage **if condos donâ€™t let you leave bins on-site**.  
3. **Compare to Failed Recycling Startups**  
   * Did they **overestimate customer willingness to pay**?  
   * Did they **scale too fast and burn cash**?

### **Addressing Identified Blind Spots**

1. **Assumption: Condos Willing to Pay Proposed Fees**  
   **Research Insights:**  
   * **Market Variability:** Pricing structures for waste collection services vary widely, influenced by factors such as collection frequency, waste volume, and additional services. For instance, in the U.S., flat monthly rates range from $20 to $50 for basic residential trash pickup, with urban areas potentially higher due to increased operational costs. â€‹[The Pricer](https://www.thepricer.org/garbage-pickup-cost/)  
2. **Recommendations:**  
   * **Conduct Market Research:** Engage with condominium associations to assess their willingness to pay. This can be achieved through surveys or pilot programs.â€‹  
   * **Flexible Pricing Models:** Consider implementing dynamic pricing strategies that adjust rates based on volume and frequency of pickup, encouraging larger contracts and regular clients. â€‹[FinModelsLab](https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/profitability/garbage-collection-services-profitability)  
3. **Assumption: Residents Will Properly Sort Recyclables**  
   **Research Insights:**  
   * **Behavioral Challenges:** Despite the availability of recycling programs, improper sorting remains a significant issue. For example, in Sydney, complex bin systems have led to confusion and reduced participation. â€‹[thetimes.co.uk](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ten-bins-per-household-recycling-rubbish-collection-r9pzj0z83)  
4. **Recommendations:**  
   * **Simplify Sorting Processes:** Provide clear guidelines and standardized bins to reduce confusion.â€‹  
   * **Incentivize Participation:** Implement reward programs for proper sorting, such as discounts or recognition.â€‹  
5. **Assumption: Internal Staff Will Not Misappropriate Recyclables**  
   **Research Insights:**  
   * **Human Rights Concerns:** The recycling industry has faced challenges related to labor conditions and fair compensation. Ensuring ethical practices is crucial for sustainability. â€‹[The Circulate Initiative](https://www.thecirculateinitiative.org/media-coverage/businesses-warned-of-human-rights-blind-spots-in-recycled-plastic-supply-chains/)  
6. **Recommendations:**  
   * **Fair Compensation:** Offer competitive wages and benefits to discourage misappropriation.â€‹  
   * **Transparent Operations:** Implement monitoring systems and foster a culture of integrity.â€‹

### **Additional Potential Blind Spots**

1. **Environmental Blind Spots:**  
   * **Increased Logistics Impact:** Expanding recycling operations can lead to higher transportation emissions if not managed efficiently. â€‹  
2. **Mitigation:**  
   * **Optimize Routes:** Use technology to plan efficient collection routes, minimizing fuel consumption.â€‹  
3. **Market Blind Spots:**  
   * **Fluctuating Material Demand:** The demand for recycled materials can be unpredictable, affecting revenue.â€‹  
4. **Mitigation:**  
   * **Diversify Markets:** Explore multiple avenues for selling recyclables to mitigate demand fluctuations.â€‹  
5. **Governance Blind Spots:**  
   * **Regulatory Changes:** New laws or policies can impact operations unexpectedly.â€‹[wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/plastic-recycling-waste-trash-tips-0a606230)  
6. **Mitigation:**  
   * **Continuous Engagement:** Maintain relationships with policymakers to stay informed and adaptable.
