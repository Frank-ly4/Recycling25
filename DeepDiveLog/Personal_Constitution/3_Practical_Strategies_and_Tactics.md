**I. Core Pillars of the New Chapter**

1. **Internal Calm**

   * Daily anchor habits (reading, walking, sauna/steam, no-phone time)
   * Stillness over stimulation
   * Reflection, not reactivity

2. **External Discipline**

   * Structured but flexible daily plans
   * Intentional work sprints (lesson prep, business plans, project sessions)
   * Financial sobriety: track expenses, reduce impulsivity, pay off debts sequentially

3. **Selective Connection**

   * Less time with friends who drain energy or create shallow routines
   * More time alone, *with intention*
   * Open to deep connection with someone aligned, but not seeking it to fill a gap

---

**II. Principles for Daily Living**

* "Sink into" the good: hobbies, projects, reading, planning, quiet enjoyment
* Avoid overstimulation and dopamine loops (weed, socials, binge eating, endless Netflix)
* Choose real rest: lying down with a book, playing a game on Switch while listening to longform content
* Use AI intentionally as a second brain, guide, and thought partner

---

**III. Tactics to Combat Loneliness While Staying Aligned**

* Use Nintendo Switch + podcasts like Wes Roth, Breaking Points, AI news, or Kill Tony
* Rewatch meaningful shows or stand-up that feels chill but mentally engaging
* Spend time in sauna/steam room without phone — a daily ritual of silence
* Let reading replace doomscrolling

---

**IV. Frictions to Avoid**

* Social outings that feel obligatory, repetitive, or financially draining
* Unstructured days that turn into weed-social-scroll loops
* Giving too much time to people who constantly ask without direction, or waste time

---

**V. Recovery from Past Habits**

* Prioritize debt repayment in this order:

  1. Bank
  2. Fern
  3. Parents
* Stop chasing novelty through spending — evaluate worth after every impulse
* Use the week to *build momentum*, not seek to escape boredom

---

**VI. Monthly Strategy (June)**

* Work lightly: 1 day/week teaching max
* Focus time on:

  * Health: light gym, walking, sauna, resting arm
  * Business: recycling plan, gold prediction research
  * Mental: reading, longform reflection, and sorting AI thoughts
* Prepare for July full-time work: clean routines, clear financial picture

**VII. Agreements Going Forward**

* You will always approve canvas updates before I make them
* We will revisit and refine this document as your rhythm changes
* This document is not a pressure — it's a compass

**Section: Combating Loneliness While Staying Aligned**

**1. Switch + Audio Reset Routine**

* When feeling lonely, bored, or tempted to scroll aimlessly, pair Nintendo Switch gameplay with meaningful audio.
* This keeps hands busy, mind calm, and aligns dopamine use with growth and reflection.

**Examples of Pairings:**

| Audio Source                         | Game                                | Purpose                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Lex Fridman / Naval                  | Stardew Valley                      | Meditative, reflective    |
| Kill Tony                            | Slay the Spire / Fire Emblem        | Humor + light strategy    |
| Hardcore History                     | Octopath Traveler / Tactics Ogre    | Deep thought + tactics    |
| Ram Dass / Alan Watts                | Spiritfarer / Celeste               | Emotional/spiritual reset |
| AI news / breaking points / Wes Roth | Pokémon TCG Live / Puyo Puyo Tetris | Chill focus               |

**2. Intentional Use Protocol**

* Prioritize audio that feeds curiosity, aligns with longer-term goals, or anchors the present moment.
* Avoid mindless content during vulnerable states (lonely, restless, high).

**3. Portable Setup Ritual**

* Keep Switch charged and headphones ready.
* Maintain a downloaded podcast/music queue and at least one offline game for instant access.

**4. Weekly Rotation Principle**

* Refresh your stack every 5–7 days to avoid content fatigue and trigger renewed interest.
* Optionally ask AI for a new combo to match mood + goals.

**Purpose:**
To soothe without self-sabotage, entertain without escapism, and build moments of recovery into daily rituals. This replaces random dopamine seeking with curated, intentional chill time.
