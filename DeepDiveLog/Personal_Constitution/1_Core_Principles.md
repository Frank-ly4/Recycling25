This is the heart of what a living constitution should be: *concrete*, *anchored in experience*, and *specific*. For each principle/example here (and the rest from Section I)has been surfaced from as many real, contextual, and verbatim examples as possible from my chats with ChatGPT. This is section 1, core principles.

# SECTION I: CORE PRINCIPLES — GRANULAR CASEBOOK

---

## **1. Radical Self-Honesty**

### **Examples & Instances:**

* **Trading Losses and Patterns (April–June 2025):**

  * *“I had one position up 10%, closed all positions, and believe I broke even or made a small profit. User intends to upload their trades later and asked for a reminder if they don't.”*
  * *“I recognize I should have closed my positions earlier and now plan to use partial closes in the future to avoid leaving money on the table while still managing risk.”*
  * *“I realized they need a wider perspective by focusing on 6-hour, daily, and higher time frames for better judgment.”*
  * You documented not only your wins, but your cycles of self-sabotage: *“I lost \$400 by trading against a clear downtrend on BTC and not using stop losses, even though I recognized the downtrend…”*

* **Substance Use Reflection (June 2025):**

  * *“I can be sober but I've realized I love a little weed, a little Pregabalin for example, particularly when I have to deal with people. I think my baseline is fairly depressed but okay… just bleh when I'm actually sober and I feel good doing fulfilling activities and with exercise and endorphins and stuff but even then pretty depressed, hence drugs sometimes.”*
  * On intention and ritual: *“Today is ritual, the price I pay for reflecting and deciding to smoke less lol and more intentionally is the key not less but just more intentionally.”*

* **Business Planning:**

  * When analyzing the recycling business: *“I want to avoid lying to myself about profitability or motivations.”*
  * *“I worry cause I barely got sportsmeet app to work but now we sort of learned a bit and will make it that much easier, even if just a bit, to do this project. It’s useful and simple and can make money too. Recycling plan finally have finished reading it, onto the next step, exporting it with notes and analysing it and seeing what we can do to really get the ball moving asap, but as best as possible.”*
  * *“I know I take on too many projects, become overwhelmed, and then disengage—leaving things unfinished or stalling my own growth.”*

* **Relationship/Identity:**

  * *“I can’t get back with her, I think after what we’ve been through if I’m with her it’s gotta be all in. Maybe not. Should I not be texting her?”*
  * In moments of shame, you referenced: *“I remember feeling really embarrassed at like age 3 or 4, and again at like age 6 or 7 cause I shit myself around my friends. There’s probably more but those examples come off the top of my head.”*
  * *“My value often feels contingent on achievement or external validation. This can lead to burnout, resentment, and feeling like an impostor—especially in new ventures or when working under scrutiny.”*

## **2. Compassionate Detachment**

### **Examples & Instances:**

* **Workplace & Teaching:**

  * When reflecting on Wall Street English, *“I disengage from work environments, friends, or partners who are emotionally abusive, manipulative, or draining. My well-being is not negotiable for the comfort of others.”*
  * *“My manager physically pulled me aside to prevent me from helping a new employee… The manager did not inquire about the nature of the conversation. Additionally, when the new employee was teased by other staff and reported it, the manager dismissed her as being too emotional and claimed it was not her responsibility to address the issue.”*
  * This led to setting boundaries: *“I am seeking external input and validation regarding their handling of their relationship breakup with Pingpong, especially about whether silence and detachment are the right approach.”*

* **Friendship (Paul):**

  * *“I made multiple efforts over the years to support and guide Paul, especially when others distanced themselves, but eventually cut him off due to his repeated draining behavior and lack of growth. Their final falling out occurred during a trip to Taipei, where Paul reacted poorly to user's expressed need for space and rest.”*
  * Reflection: *“He constantly loops in unresolved trauma, displays manipulative and stubborn behavior, and does not genuinely engage in reciprocal conversation… I have made multiple efforts to support and guide Paul, especially when others distanced themselves, but eventually cut him off due to his repeated draining behavior and lack of growth.”*

* **Romantic Relationship (Pingpong):**

  * *“Should I not be texting her? We both text each other. I feel like we are both getting to the states of getting to that different place each of us and we can talk thru it. All these kind of rainy cool nights calm chill getting into the evening it’s like 9:00 p.m. now make me think of ping pong and make me miss her and I wish she was here with me and all these moments…”*
  * Detachment through silence: *“I just keep messaging her and we keep sending each other media too. Truth be told I want to be with her. Not now maybe I still need my rhythm and she hers and we can see if they meld. And I can’t stop thinking she had or will cheat… She said she got me a gift in a trip she’s on now. She said she'll send it. See, neither of us trying to see one another in person. Maybe she is? Maybe she is but not now? Idk if I should even think about it.”*

## **3. Growth Through Reflection**

### **Examples & Instances:**

* **Trading and Project Management:**

  * *“Should prepare lesson plans sooner. Fun using Streamlit, useful, how to make it more useful though (my particular analysis project) and what are similar adjacent things we can do with Streamlit? I have a good idea for an expense tracker app. I worry cause I barely got sportsmeet app to work but now we sort of learned a bit and will make it that much easier, even if just a bit, to do this project.”*
  * *“The ideas I had that are slipping but I think are good is using the prediction methods for gold prices and getting back into that, the forecasting with ML. Sort of a lot to juggle but my focus is better now…”*

* **Emotional Pain as Catalyst:**

  * *“Every painful experience is an invitation to see more clearly.”*
  * Processing the breakup with Pingpong: *“I think after what we’ve been through if I’m with her it’s gotta be all in. Maybe not… I feel like we are both getting to the states of getting to that different place each of us and we can talk thru it.”*
  * *“Endings are teachers. My breakup with Pingpong, and the arc of my friendship with Paul, taught me the value of detachment, the dangers of rescue fantasies, and the importance of walking away with dignity.”*

* **Regular Journaling and Self-Review:**

  * *“Reflection is a ritual; I will journal, review, and revisit my thinking to adjust course.”*
  * *“My systems (AI tools, journaling, project boards) must evolve. I release the need for ‘perfect structure’ and embrace iterative progress.”*

## **4. Selective Connection**

### **Examples & Instances:**

* **Romantic Selectivity:**

  * *“I choose distance or silence over chasing validation or belonging where it is not mutual.”*
  * *“I just keep messaging her and we keep sending each other media too. Truth be told I want to be with her. Not now maybe I still need my rhythm and she hers and we can see if they meld. And I can’t stop thinking she had or will cheat…”*
  * *“She said she got me a gift in a trip she's on now. She said she'll send it. See, neither of us trying to see one another in person. Maybe she is? Maybe not. Idk if I should even think about it…”*

* **Friendships:**

  * With Paul: *“I have made multiple efforts to support and guide Paul, especially when others distanced themselves, but eventually cut him off due to his repeated draining behavior and lack of growth.”*
  * You reflected that “maintaining ties out of guilt or nostalgia keeps you from investing in the present.”

* **Professional Boundaries:**

  * *“I disengage from work environments, friends, or partners who are emotionally abusive, manipulative, or draining. My well-being is not negotiable for the comfort of others.”*

## **5. Autonomy Over Reaction**

### **Examples & Instances:**

* **Workplace Triggers:**

  * *“In workplace struggles, you described not letting immediate anger or frustration drive your responses to toxic management (‘My manager physically pulled me aside to prevent me from helping a new employee… she dismissed the issue…’)”*
  * When asked about management at Wall Street: *“I want to file a formal workplace complaint focused on securing compensation and a clean departure, not improving the work environment. They have experienced emotional abuse, favoritism, exclusion, and a toxic culture, and are gathering evidence to support their case.”*
  * *“You’ve tracked how quickly you can swing from sensitivity to detachment, and set the intention: ‘I will pause before reacting, especially in the face of old triggers…’”*

* **Relationship Triggers:**

  * *“I both crave and fear solitude. I recharge alone but can retreat into isolation when anxious or hurt, using it as an armor against intimacy or risk.”*
  * *“When wounded, I withdraw, suppress feelings, or doubt the intentions of those close to me—this sabotages relationships and deep connection.”*

## **6. Creative Discipline**

### **Examples & Instances:**

* **Project Initiation and Cycles:**

  * *“You’ve started and stopped numerous projects (recycling plan, SportsMeet app, expense tracker), but you keep coming back to the core idea: ‘My work, be it writing, building, or coding, is an anchor and an act of self-respect.’”*
  * *“Recognized ‘unfinished projects are not failures—they are lessons in momentum, timing, and desire.’”*
  * *“I want to return to prediction and forecasting models (especially related to gold trading), update their trading journal, and potentially connect this work to Streamlit and Polymarket as a small, fun forecasting project.”*
  * *“I’m using the indicators for trading, my McGinley iteration with ATR bands, I should assess its effectiveness.”*
  * *“Recycling plan finally have finished reading it, onto the next step, exporting it with notes and analysing it and seeing what we can do to really get the ball moving asap, but as best as possible.”*

* **Iterative Practice:**

  * *“My systems (AI tools, journaling, project boards) must evolve. I release the need for ‘perfect structure’ and embrace iterative progress.”*

* **Shipping over Perfection:**

  * *“A finished project, however small, trumps endless ideation. I commit to closing loops, publishing, shipping, or sharing—celebrating completion over perfection.”*

## **7. Transparency in Intentions**

### **Examples & Instances:**

* **Professional Communication:**

  * *“Send a message to my old manager, don't care in the slightest about our personal relations. I just want the paperwork.”*
  * *“Euro-Center said I need: Certificate of Employment (COE)… what if they don’t get back to me?”*

* **Personal Boundaries:**

  * *“I will be upfront about what I want, in relationships, work, and self-care. I refuse hidden agendas, passive resentment, and unspoken expectations.”*

---

## **8. Courage to Endure Discomfort**

### **Examples & Instances:**

* **Loneliness & Stillness:**

  * *“You described sitting with loneliness in Taipei, and with discomfort at work and in romantic withdrawal. ‘I embrace boredom, loneliness, or pain as necessary phases—not things to numb or escape at all cost.’”*
  * *“In chats about drug use, you articulated a philosophy: ‘It’s not about not doing drugs, it’s about regulating your own usage, understanding your usage, being aware and educated, and not falling into them as a crutch…’”*

* **Intentional Use of Substances:**

  * *“Today is ritual, the price I pay for reflecting and deciding to smoke less lol and more intentionally is the key not less but just more intentionally.”*
  * *“I can be sober but I've realized I love a little weed, a little Pregabalin for example, particularly when I have to deal with people. I think my baseline is fairly depressed but okay…”*

* **Facing Unfinished Business:**

  * *“You’ve started and stopped numerous projects… My unfinished projects are not failures—they are lessons in momentum, timing, and desire.”*
