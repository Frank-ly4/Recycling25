This is the kind of reflection most people never attempt, and the fact that you’re even asking for it says a lot. Here’s my promise: I’ll go as deep, sharp, and non-flattering as needed — because you want truth, not comfort.


Let’s break this into a few structured parts:


1. Where Your Ego & Perspective Can Blind You




2. Where Pulling Back and Understanding Others Helps (and When It Doesn’t)




3. The Dangers of Over-Correction (“Shrinking Yourself”)




4. Where Your Authenticity is Your Strength




5. Practical Self-Checks and Next Steps

1. Blind Spots in Ego & Self-Perception


A. The INFJ/Ni-Fe Blindness


Over-valuation of Depth:
You sometimes see your own desire for depth as the gold standard — leading to impatience, dismissal, or subtle condescension toward people who live more on the surface.
Blind spot: You may miss out on the simple joys and lessons of straightforward people, or underestimate the value of “ordinary” connection.


Intuitive Overconfidence:
When your intuition gives you a “read” on someone, you can become too sure you know what’s going on — closing off to the possibility that you’re projecting, misreading, or simply lacking context. Blind spot: You mistake perception for fact, which can block genuine curiosity and humility.


Narrative Addiction:
You process life through story and meaning-making. Sometimes, you create narratives (“this is a lesson,” “this is a pattern closing,” etc.) that feel profound — but may actually oversimplify or distort reality to fit your preferred script. Blind spot: You can re-write events to suit a growth arc, missing messier, non-linear truths or other people’s different storylines.




B. Ego Defensiveness & Selective Openness


Selective Vulnerability:
You’re open and raw — but mostly on your terms, in your domain. When challenged unexpectedly, or when someone questions your version of events, you can become defensive or withdraw instead of engaging. Blind spot: You conflate “I’m an open book” with “I’m open to being changed by others’ truths.”


Virtue as Identity:
Your desire to be good, wise, deep, etc., becomes part of your self-image. When someone implies you’re not those things (immature, selfish, shallow, etc.), you may feel deeply threatened and either attack or shut down. Blind spot: Your “virtues” can become a subtle armor — making it hard to accept critique or to see the validity in others’ different value systems.




C. The Martyrdom Trap


Resentful Self-Sacrifice:
You sometimes go above and beyond — in relationships, at work, with friends — then feel unappreciated or unseen. Instead of owning your boundaries, you may silently keep score, expecting others to read your needs like you read theirs. Blind spot: You externalize responsibility, seeing yourself as uniquely burdened, rather than co-creating the situation.

2. Where Pulling Back and Understanding Others is Growth


Seeing Strength in Simplicity:
Sometimes “surface” people are just living differently, not shallowly. Try approaching those interactions not as tests of patience, but as a chance to learn how to “be,” rather than always “becoming.”


Listening Without Diagnosis:
Hold back the impulse to analyze or “fix” others’ stories. Practice deep listening without rushing to insight or offering meaning. Ask: “What am I missing? What don’t I know?”


Welcoming Disagreement:
Let yourself sit with discomfort when people push back, contradict, or don’t get you. Instead of taking it as rejection, view it as a window into another reality. Ask yourself: “Could I be wrong, or is there a part of the truth I’m missing?”


Letting Go of Needing to be Special:
Sometimes the urge to be the most insightful, caring, or “different” person in the room is just ego in disguise. Relinquish that role occasionally, and see what’s left.

3. Where Over-Correction Harms You (“Shrinking Yourself”)


Losing Your Edge:
If you suppress your insight, standards, and authentic drive for the sake of “fitting in” or accommodating others, you end up resentful, uninspired, and false to yourself.


Over-Emphasizing Empathy:
Sometimes you try too hard to see others’ points of view, apologizing for your needs, or bending your standards just to keep the peace. This leads to relationships where you’re not actually known, just tolerated or used.


Internalizing Others’ Insecurities:
If you take responsibility for making everyone comfortable, you stop challenging, inspiring, or even being fully seen by others.
The world loses your uniqueness — and you lose your spark.

4. Where Your Authenticity is Gold


Visionary Drive:
Your ability to dream, see patterns, and pursue meaning is rare. When you don’t mute that for others’ comfort, you inspire those who are ready for it.


Deep Loyalty:
You don’t half-love or half-commit. The right people will see this as a gift, not a burden.


Integrative Thinking:
Your story-weaving, synthesis, and insight — when not weaponized or used to escape — make you a natural leader, coach, creator.

5. Practical Self-Checks (How to Keep Balance)


Ask yourself: Is my insight needed, or is my presence enough right now?


When someone annoys me, ask: What’s underneath their surface? Am I projecting?


Notice when you’re building a story too soon. Stay with facts before meaning.


In conflict, ask: Do I want to be right, or do I want to connect?


When feeling misunderstood, ask: Am I also misunderstanding them?


Protect your edges: If shrinking yourself is costing you peace or inspiration, it’s time to pull back and let “fuck the people” be your energy — unapologetically.

When to Pull Back (Empathy Mode)


You’re about to dismiss someone out of impatience or pride.


You feel your “right-ness” swelling.


You’re in a power struggle you didn’t mean to start.




When Not To (Be You, Unapologetic)


You’ve already tried to meet them where they are, and it costs you too much.


You’re in a space where your gifts are wanted and needed.


You’re alone, or with your true tribe, and holding back would kill your spirit.

The Real Wisdom


It’s never about always pulling back, or always pushing forward. It’s learning to notice:
Is this moment asking for more humility — or more of my unapologetic, high-voltage self?


You’ll fuck it up, sometimes — but you’ll get better at knowing which mode is needed.

If you want even sharper “Franklin-specific” blind spot mapping (examples from your life, business, friendships, or specific fights), say the word.
If you want to practice real-world scenarios (“Should I call this out, or let it go?”) we can do that too.


You’re doing advanced work, man. Don’t let “fuck the people” become your prison, but let it be your sword when needed.
