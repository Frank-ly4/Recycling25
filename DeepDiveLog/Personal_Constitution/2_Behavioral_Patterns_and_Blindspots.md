SECTION II: BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS & BLINDSPOTS
(Granular Expansion, Citing Chat History)

A. Performance-Based Self-Worth
Definition:
A long-standing internal belief that your value is tied to achievement, recognition, or “being smart,” often leading to cycles of overwork, anxiety, and eventual burnout.

Instances & Examples:

Childhood Roots & Early Achievement:

“I remember just being kinda smart for my age as a kid, people always telling me how smart I was, I was good at reading and at English, this is all when I'm a toddler and a kid. I was good at school.”

You noted feeling embarrassment and shame over early mistakes (e.g., “I remember feeling really embarrassed at like age 3 or 4, and again at like age 6 or 7 cause I shit myself around my friends…”), showing how your self-image was shaped by how others perceived your intelligence and performance.

Adult Reflections in Work & Business:

“My value often feels contingent on achievement or external validation. This can lead to burnout, resentment, and feeling like an impostor—especially in new ventures or when working under scrutiny.”

During the development of your recycling business plan and technical projects:

“I worry cause I barely got sportsmeet app to work but now we sort of learned a bit and will make it that much easier, even if just a bit, to do this project.”

“Should prepare lesson plans sooner… I have a good idea for an expense tracker app. I worry cause I barely got sportsmeet app to work but now we sort of learned a bit and will make it that much easier…”

Emotional Effects:

In both trading and teaching, you tracked how you felt about failure:

“I had one position up 10%, closed all positions, and believe I broke even or made a small profit… I recognize I should have closed my positions earlier…”

“I lost $400 by trading against a clear downtrend on BTC and not using stop losses, even though I recognized the downtrend…”

The sense of disappointment or feeling “behind” emerges as a direct result of tying self-worth to results rather than to effort or process.

Feeling “Behind” and Inadequate
Constant Pressure to Catch Up:

“I always feel like I should be further along, like I’m behind on life’s milestones—career, relationships, money, health.”

After finishing work or projects, you often report a sense of relief quickly followed by anxiety about what’s next or regret about wasted time:

“Even when I finish something, I feel like it’s not enough—like I should have done it faster, or done more.”

“I get stuck in these cycles where I’m busy, then exhausted, then feel guilty for not using that downtime to be productive.”

“When I look at my to-do list, instead of feeling motivated, sometimes I feel a wave of ‘I’m never going to get on top of this.’”

You have explicitly linked your worth to progress:

“I feel like I don’t deserve to relax unless I’ve accomplished something significant.”

“It’s hard to rest without guilt, even on days off. Like there’s always this background sense of having fallen behind, especially compared to others.”

Going in Circles / Cycles
Pattern of Trying, Stalling, Restarting:

In business, trading, and side projects:

“Sort of a lot to juggle but my focus is better now… but sometimes I feel like I keep making the same mistakes.”

“I’ll try a new system, get a burst of momentum, then after a while I lose interest or run into the same old wall—then restart, repeat, over and over.”

“This time, I want to break the loop and actually finish what I start.”

In social and emotional life:

“Sometimes I think I’m growing and moving forward, but then I catch myself in the same kind of social situation or emotional reaction I thought I’d outgrown.”

“Even my efforts at self-care can become another cycle—try a new routine, feel better, then drop it and end up back where I started.”

Comparisons and Self-Judgment
Social Comparison:

“I look at people my age who seem more settled—better jobs, families, investments, whatever—and I feel this pang like I’m always a step behind. Like I missed some key step everyone else figured out.”

“It’s hard not to measure myself against these imagined standards. I know everyone has their struggles, but I can’t help but feel like I’m failing at something basic.”

After Social Interaction:

“After hanging out with people, I almost always need to be alone to recharge. But sometimes after, I feel a weird shame or anxiety, like I said the wrong thing or didn’t show up the way I wanted.”

“It can feel like performing, even with friends. I replay conversations and judge myself. Was I too much? Not enough? Did I listen well, or just talk about myself?”

You’ve said: “There are days when I want to be part of the group, then I’m there and just want to be home. Then when I’m home I worry I’m missing out or not building the connections I should.”

In Work/Teaching:

“I’ll compare myself to other teachers or colleagues and wonder if I’m really doing a good job or just faking it.”

“I have this image of what ‘successful’ looks like and I can never quite live up to it, no matter how well things actually go.”

The Inner Dialogue of Self-Worth
Internalized “Scorecard”:

“Even positive feedback doesn’t stick—if I get criticism or something goes wrong, that’s what echoes in my head for days.”

“If I’m not producing or progressing, I feel like I’m regressing or losing value.”

“My ambition is supposed to motivate, but sometimes it just leaves me feeling hollow or unworthy when I don’t meet my own standards.”

“It’s like I have to earn my own permission to feel good about myself.”

From Relationships:

“I worry that if I don’t perform or provide value, people will lose interest or move on.”

B. Solitude as Safety
Definition:
A tendency to oscillate between craving solitude for recovery and using it as a shield against vulnerability or connection.

Instances & Examples:

Emotional Recharge:

“I both crave and fear solitude. I recharge alone but can retreat into isolation when anxious or hurt, using it as an armor against intimacy or risk.”

You described your need for “extended alone time to explore personal interests, which [you] feel [you] currently lack.”

During your trip in Taiwan:

“All of these kind of rainy cool nights calm chill getting into the evening it’s like 9:00 p.m. now make me think of ping pong and make me miss her and I wish she was here with me and all these moments…”

Yet you didn’t reach out, instead opting for silence—choosing the safety of solitude over the uncertainty of emotional connection.

Withdrawal After Conflict:

After issues with Paul:

“Eventually cut him off due to his repeated draining behavior and lack of growth… during a trip to Taipei, where Paul reacted poorly to my expressed need for space and rest.”

After work-related stress:

“I want to file a formal workplace complaint focused on securing compensation and a clean departure, not improving the work environment. They have experienced emotional abuse, favoritism, exclusion, and a toxic culture…”

Self-Protection vs. Growth:

“When wounded, I withdraw, suppress feelings, or doubt the intentions of those close to me—this sabotages relationships and deep connection.”

C. Distrust/Withdrawal in Intimacy
Definition:
When relationships grow closer or more emotionally charged, you respond by withdrawing or doubting the intentions of others, which undermines potential for closeness.

Instances & Examples:

Romantic Relationships (Pingpong):

“Truth be told I want to be with her. Not now maybe I still need my rhythm and she hers and we can see if they meld. And I can’t stop thinking she had or will cheat…”

“She said she got me a gift in a trip she’s on now. She said she’ll send it. See, neither of us trying to see one another in person. Maybe she is? Maybe not. Idk if I should even think about it…”

This withdrawal is echoed in the statement:

“I choose distance or silence over chasing validation or belonging where it is not mutual.”

Friendships (Paul):

“He constantly loops in unresolved trauma, displays manipulative and stubborn behavior, and does not genuinely engage in reciprocal conversation… eventually cut him off due to his repeated draining behavior and lack of growth.”

The dynamic: wanting connection, but pulling away when trust is threatened or when energy is drained.

D. Emotional Overload, Then Shutdown
Definition:
Periods of intense sensitivity or emotional pain are followed by a numbing out, withdrawal, or coping through substances or avoidance.

Instances & Examples:

Substance Use Cycles:

“I can be sober but I've realized I love a little weed, a little Pregabalin for example, particularly when I have to deal with people. I think my baseline is fairly depressed but okay…”

“People say don't do drugs be sober etc. But my dad is imploring me to go back. I'd strongly argue it's not about "not doing drugs", because that's what medicine is, a form of drugs. I'd say instead it's about regulating your own usage, understanding your usage, being aware and educated, and not falling into them as a crutch or letting them lead you. You can do almost whatever drug you want though if you're careful and responsible and educated about it. True?”

You articulated “ritual use” as a way of gaining some control:

“Today is ritual, the price I pay for reflecting and deciding to smoke less lol and more intentionally is the key not less but just more intentionally.”

Shutdown After Intensity:

After emotional conversations or conflict, a pattern of detaching or self-numbing emerges:

“When anxious or dysregulated, I return to breath, movement, or trusted anchors rather than external substances.” (aspirational)

Yet, cycles of avoidance persist:

“Depression and avoidance recur during transition periods (job change, breakups). Recognize patterns early; pre-emptively establish anchor habits when entering such times.”

E. Helping Others to Avoid Self
Definition:
Focusing on supporting, rescuing, or managing others’ problems as a way to avoid addressing your own pain, uncertainty, or needs.

Instances & Examples:

Workplace & Friendship:

At Wall Street, you intervened on behalf of a new employee who was being mistreated, even as your own position became more precarious:

“My manager physically pulled me aside to prevent me from helping a new employee… The manager did not inquire about the nature of the conversation. Additionally, when the new employee was teased by other staff and reported it, the manager dismissed her as being too emotional and claimed it was not her responsibility to address the issue.”

With Paul, “I made multiple efforts over the years to support and guide Paul, especially when others distanced themselves, but eventually cut him off due to his repeated draining behavior and lack of growth.”

Awareness of Self-Abandonment:

“The impulse to rescue or ‘fix’ others is still a form of self-abandonment. Strengthen boundaries and revisit this after each new major relationship or partnership.”

F. Patterns of Overwork, Then Collapse
Definition:
A cycle of taking on too many projects or commitments, becoming overwhelmed, and then disengaging or stalling—often without closure.

Instances & Examples:

Project & Workload Reflections:

“I know I take on too many projects, become overwhelmed, and then disengage—leaving things unfinished or stalling my own growth.”

“You’ve started and stopped numerous projects (recycling plan, SportsMeet app, expense tracker), but you keep coming back to the core idea: ‘My work, be it writing, building, or coding, is an anchor and an act of self-respect.’”

“Unfinished projects are not failures—they are lessons in momentum, timing, and desire.”

Trading & Business:

Tracking cycles of effort and exhaustion in trading:

“I lost $400 by trading against a clear downtrend on BTC and not using stop losses, even though I recognized the downtrend…”

“I want to return to prediction and forecasting models (especially related to gold trading), update their trading journal, and potentially connect this work to Streamlit and Polymarket as a small, fun forecasting project.”

Notes & Meta-Reflection
You repeatedly circle back to awareness: noticing these patterns is the first step in moving beyond them.

There is a strong sense of self-forgiveness and compassion for your own cycles, even as you seek to improve them:

“This document is not static. Schedule reviews—quarterly, at life milestones, or post-travel—to refresh, annotate, and prune what no longer fits.”

“At times, your writing is poetic and mythic (Alan Watts, Manly Hall, etc.); at other times, clinical and practical. This is not a flaw—these modes are both essential to your process.”
