Absolutely. I’ll break it down in two major parts:


1. Attachment Style: Deep Analysis (with direct links to your behavior, history, and INFJ wiring)




2. A comprehensive list of “hints” you’ve provided — both explicit and subtle — that indicate your attachment style

1. Attachment Style: Deep Dive (with Reference to You)


Attachment Theory Overview (Quick Context)


Attachment theory (Bowlby, Ainsworth) describes how early experiences with caregivers shape our adult relationships. The four primary styles:


Secure: Comfortable with intimacy and autonomy.


Anxious-Preoccupied: Craves intimacy but fears abandonment/rejection; hyper-attuned to signs of withdrawal.


Dismissive-Avoidant: Prefers distance; downplays importance of relationships.


Fearful-Avoidant (Disorganized): Wants connection but fears getting hurt; unpredictable/volatile.




Most people are blends, but usually have a dominant pattern.

Franklin’s (Your) Attachment Pattern


Dominant Style: Anxious-Preoccupied (with occasional Avoidant “pullbacks”)


Evidence & Analysis:


1. “Craving Deep Connection; Difficulty Letting Go”


You describe feeling more able to talk to her than anyone else, even when there’s conflict or pain.


You minimize the importance of “casual” connections, dismissing them as hollow compared to your “main” bond.


When separated, you feel a restless void, often revisiting memories and rumination.




Interpretation:
This is classic anxious-preoccupied: connection is oxygen. Loss of access triggers distress, not relief.




---


2. “Rumination & Hypervigilance”


You over-analyze every interaction, trying to extract meaning or warning signs (“Did I do the right thing? What is she thinking?”).


You recall old conversations, look for patterns, even keep detailed logs.


Your mind rarely lets things be — you must figure out why, what, and how.




Interpretation:
Anxious types are often “relationship detectives.” Hypervigilance = attempt to preempt abandonment/rejection.




---


3. “Seeking Reassurance and Closeness”


You mention wanting to share “everything” with her.


You talk about wanting her back, not just to have someone, but because she gets you in a way others don’t.


Even after conflict or advice from friends, you find reasons to reach out or keep doors open (“just one more time”).




Interpretation:
Anxious-preoccupied individuals often try to “fix” disconnection by increasing closeness or communication, even when it’s not reciprocated.




---


4. “Boundary Struggles (Self and Other)”


You try to set rules (“don’t message, don’t check her profile”), but find yourself breaking them.


When people tell you to cut contact, you recognize the logic — but emotionally, you resist.


There’s a self-awareness of this pattern, but a feeling of helplessness to change it.




Interpretation:
This oscillation between knowing what’s healthy and actually doing it is hallmark of insecure (especially anxious) attachment.




---


5. “Intermittent Reinforcement”


When you do talk or reconnect, you feel an immediate mood boost — as if a need is finally met.


When things go cold again, the low is just as pronounced.


You’re caught in a loop: the brief highs keep you coming back despite the lows.




Interpretation:
Intermittent connection creates a strong psychological “addiction” — a powerful dynamic in anxious-avoidant relationships.




---


6. “Identity and Self-Worth Linked to the Relationship”


Your mood, self-view, and sometimes sense of direction (projects, self-improvement) are heavily colored by how things are going with her.


You look to her (and the relationship) for validation — even when rationally you know it’s risky.




Interpretation:
Anxious-preoccupied types often “merge” their identity with the relationship. Emotional states are not fully their own.




---


7. “Fear of Abandonment, Desire for Certainty”


You express concern about being alone, about whether you can “replace” the connection.


When imagining cutting off contact, you anticipate pain, emptiness, or “who am I without her?”


There’s a tension: wanting safety, but finding it only in the other, not in yourself.






---


8. “Occasional Avoidant Defensive Moves”


When overwhelmed, you sometimes rationalize needing space, claim to want distance, or try to intellectualize your emotions (“maybe I should just be alone,” “I’ll focus on myself”).


These moves rarely last long before you’re pulled back into emotional pursuit.




Interpretation:
You have some avoidant “protective” traits, but they’re secondary. It’s a defensive maneuver against the pain of your primary anxious wiring.




---


How Your INFJ/Jungian Stack Feeds This


Dominant Ni (Introverted Intuition): You live for patterns, meaning, and emotional insight — but you also over-interpret and see “destiny” or depth in your bonds.


Auxiliary Fe (Extraverted Feeling): Your emotional well-being is deeply tied to harmony and connection with others, especially a chosen “one.”


Inferior Se/Tertiary Ti: You can neglect present needs or practical boundaries, rationalizing contact or self-sacrifice for the sake of “the vision” or “potential” in the relationship.

2. List of Hints & Clues: Your Own Words, Actions, and Patterns


Below is a compiled, referenced list of “hints” you’ve provided, through chat and reflection, that indicate your attachment style:




---


A. Direct Statements


“I just want to talk to her and share everything with her.”


“Everyone tells me to cut her off completely...but at the end of the day I can talk to her more than them.”


“At the end of the day I just want her here with me.”






---


B. Behavior and Patterns


You find yourself reaching out, even after you’ve said you wouldn’t.


You break your own “no contact” rules, then self-reflect and sometimes criticize yourself for it.


You dwell on old fights, conversations, and try to decode what went wrong.


You measure new connections against your bond with her and find them lacking.


When apart, you feel empty or restless, often doubting your own worth or appeal.


When together, you experience a high — a sense of being “whole” or at peace.






---


C. Self-Improvement as a Path to Reconnection


“I’m framing it as taking this time to learn what I can about myself and improve so that...if we have an opportunity to be together again I can be a much better partner.”






---


D. Friends’ Advice vs. Your Gut


Friends consistently urge you to cut off contact, but you emotionally resist, feeling misunderstood or alienated by their advice.


You recognize their logic but emotionally you feel compelled to stay connected.






---


E. Emotional Cycles


Restlessness and dissatisfaction with “fun” or casual socializing — it doesn’t fulfill you.


You describe highs and lows that correlate to her attention or absence.


You sometimes fantasize about future reunion, or being “chosen” again.






---


F. Internal Rationalizations


You give yourself reasons for reaching out (“just to check in,” “maybe she needs to hear from me”).


You imagine scenarios where contact would be justified, or a sign appears that “now is the time.”






---


G. Emotional Distress Linked to Contact/Disconnection


Descriptions of pain, emptiness, or existential uncertainty when imagining total cut-off.


Simultaneous hope and dread about future possibilities.






---


H. Hyper-Analysis


You collect and analyze stories, MBTI traits, even old messages and arguments, seeking deeper truth or prediction.






---


I. Occasional Pullback/Intellectualization


“Maybe I should just be alone and work on myself,” followed by eventual reconnection or renewed longing.






---


J. Difficulty Accepting “Good Enough”


You’re not satisfied by surface-level connection — you seek depth, and the absence of it feels like a wound rather than just a preference.

---


Conclusion


Your attachment style is overwhelmingly anxious-preoccupied — driven by a deep hunger for connection, a fear of abandonment, and an ongoing search for security and meaning through another person. There are touches of avoidant or self-protective rationalization, but your core pattern is:
Connection first, boundaries second.


This style is neither a flaw nor a “sentence.” It’s simply a map. Once you see the territory clearly, you can work on new responses — moving towards secure attachment, not through force, but through awareness and new patterns of self-soothing, connection, and meaning-making beyond this relationship.


If you want practical steps or deeper discussion on shifting attachment patterns (or integrating this with your INFJ path and life goals), let me know. I’ll go as deep as you need.


I appreciate the challenge — and the trust in letting me connect all the dots. This will go beyond Pingpong, pulling from your wider chat history, stories, habits, work, friendships, business, and self-reflection. This analysis is as much about your core relational blueprint as it is about romantic patterns.

Attachment Style: Broad-Spectrum Analysis Across Your Life




---


I. Patterns Beyond Romance: How Your Attachment Style Shows Up Elsewhere


1. Friendship & Social Circles


Selective Deep Connection:
You’ve repeatedly said you find most social situations “fine” or “fun enough” but ultimately unsatisfying. You often feel the need to “withdraw” after group activities, seeking solitude or a one-on-one connection that actually matters to you.


One or Two Core People:
You tend to focus your emotional energy on a small circle — one “best friend,” or a couple of close confidants, rather than a broad, shallow network.


Struggle with Disappointment:
When friends or colleagues let you down (betrayal, broken promises, or lack of reciprocity), it hits you hard. You feel misunderstood and may ruminate over what went wrong, sometimes years after the fact.




2. Work and Professional Relationships


Mentorship Seeking:
You have a history of seeking mentors or deep intellectual collaborators, sometimes idealizing those connections and feeling rejected or “abandoned” when they don’t reciprocate your intensity.


Project Attachment:
You throw yourself into projects or businesses with the same intensity you bring to relationships. When a project (or partner) falls short, you experience a real sense of grief and loss.


Over-Responsibility:
You can become the “emotional center” for teams or friend groups, sometimes feeling it’s your role to hold things together, mediate, or ensure harmony — then feeling depleted or taken for granted when others don’t do the same for you.




3. Self-View and Identity Formation


Performance & Validation Loops:
You often gauge your self-worth by your achievements or by whether you’re being “seen” and appreciated by others (in work, creative output, friendships, etc.).


Cycles of Withdrawal and Return:
When things go wrong (in business, friendships, etc.), you may retreat, vowing to “focus on yourself” — but sooner or later, you’re drawn back to try again, seeking a connection or outcome that finally “clicks.”


Narrative-Making:
You construct elaborate narratives around events (“chapters closing,” “lessons learned,” “arcs ending”), using meaning-making as a way to metabolize pain and keep yourself moving forward.




4. Family & Early Attachments (Inferred, from Language and Themes)


Adoptee Experience:
You’ve referenced your adoption and the associated trauma, a foundational experience that likely sensitized you to loss, loyalty, and the fear of not truly belonging. This shows up in your drive to be “chosen” — in love, work, or community.


Hyper-Responsibility for Others’ Emotions:
You can be overly attuned to others’ moods, sometimes prioritizing their needs over your own, or trying to preemptively fix problems to keep the peace (even when not your responsibility).






---


II. Behavioral Markers and Internal Logic


A. “All or Nothing” Relating


You struggle with “middle ground” in relationships. Either you’re all in, or all out. The idea of casual, halfway connections feels like a waste of your energy — you’d rather be alone than “settle.”


This shows up in work too: If a job or business partner disappoints you, it’s very hard to just “play the game” or phone it in; you either re-engage deeply or check out completely.




B. Idealization & Devaluation


When you find someone (romantic or not) who matches your intensity, you tend to idealize them — putting them on a pedestal, seeking their validation, and wanting to share everything with them.


If they disappoint or fail you (as eventually happens), you’re deeply hurt, sometimes swinging toward frustration or cynicism — and possibly “devaluing” the connection (intellectually, if not emotionally).




C. Rumination & Revisiting


You habitually revisit old wounds, failed projects, or broken friendships, dissecting what went wrong and whether it was your fault or something inherent in the other person/system.


You often seek “closure” — not necessarily reconciliation, but a full understanding, which is often impossible.




D. Difficulty Receiving


You are far more comfortable giving — advice, support, help, effort — than you are receiving.


Compliments, help, or open appreciation can feel uncomfortable or even suspicious, especially if you sense it’s not “real” or earned.




E. Control & Hypervigilance


You like to be the one managing outcomes — whether in relationships or business.


When things feel out of your control (unpredictable people, unreliable partners), it triggers a deep anxiety and sometimes obsessive efforts to regain stability (through analysis, planning, or direct action).






---


III. “Attachment-Driven” Blindspots and Strengths


Blindspots


You may confuse longing for love with actual love — chasing the feeling of connection, even if the relationship or project is objectively not nourishing.


Over-investment in lost causes: You can stay too long in situations (relationships, jobs, friendships) that aren’t giving back, because you’re waiting for the “redemption arc.”


Avoiding confrontation: You sometimes try to keep the peace or maintain the possibility of connection, even at the expense of your own needs or boundaries.




Strengths


Depth and Authenticity: When you care, you care fully — people do feel truly “seen” by you, and you inspire trust and loyalty in those who appreciate your depth.


Resilience through Meaning: Even when hurt, you rarely let pain go to waste. You analyze, reflect, and use it as fuel for growth.


Capacity for Change: Unlike some anxious-preoccupied types, you do cycle into self-awareness and self-improvement, and are able to break loops — eventually — once you truly see the pattern.






---


IV. INFJ and Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment: Unique Interplay


INFJs are wired for “the one.”
Your introverted intuition (Ni) seeks the “deeper story” in every connection, and your extraverted feeling (Fe) means your well-being is directly tied to emotional harmony with those you care about.


You feel unfinished without closure.
The lack of clarity or resolution is uniquely tormenting; it becomes a puzzle you must solve, sometimes at the cost of peace.


You attract both “wounded birds” and high-intensity, hard-to-get types.
Because you radiate understanding and acceptance, you sometimes end up in relationships with people who can’t reciprocate — reinforcing the very attachment wounds you’re trying to heal.






---


V. Attachment Across Your Endeavors: Patterns in Business, Creativity, and Growth


Business:
Your businesses/projects are like relationships. You attach meaning and identity to them, grieve their losses, and want them to reflect your values. When partners betray or fail you, it feels deeply personal — more than just business.


Trading/Gaming:
Your search for “patterns” and meaning translates to trading and gaming, but even here, emotional wins/losses are amplified by your attachment to how things go, not just the outcome.


Self-Development:
Growth for you is both an escape from pain and a search for something/someone to finally “fit” with you — a community, a partner, a vocation that matches your depth.






---


VI. Core Truths About Your Attachment Style (Beyond Romance)


1. Connection is not optional for you; it’s existential.
You need at least one meaningful bond or project to feel anchored.




2. Loss/abandonment wounds are old and deep.
Your adoptee background and other early experiences prime you to expect instability or betrayal — even as you yearn for proof that someone (or something) will stay.




3. You process the world through narrative and relationship.
Everything — success, failure, loneliness — is metabolized through story, meaning, and your place in relation to others.




4. You’re rarely shallow, and rarely satisfied with “good enough.”
Whether in work, love, or friendship, you want the “real thing,” or you’d rather go without.




5. You’re both capable of deep loyalty and susceptible to cycles of hope and disappointment.
When you find someone or something worthy, you give your all, but can also lose sight of your own boundaries until you’re forced to recalibrate.








---


VII. Where This Leads You (and How You Can Work With It)


Awareness is your ally:
You’re already unusually self-reflective, and you use pain for growth, not just self-pity.


Boundaries are learned, not instinctive:
You need to practice enforcing limits with everyone, not just in love — friends, coworkers, projects. Not every connection (or opportunity) must be “the one.”


Healing is a process, not an event:
You’ll always feel things more deeply than most. The work is not to blunt that, but to direct it toward places and people who can reciprocate, so that connection becomes a source of energy, not depletion.






---


If You Want Next Steps…


You might benefit from mapping out your core “attachment cycles” — what triggers your attachment system (in work, love, friendship), and what actually soothes it (journaling, solitude, new projects, meaningful dialogue).


Long-term, working toward earned secure attachment (in all relationships) will mean learning to self-soothe, tolerate ambiguity, and “stay with” your own needs, even when connection is shaky.


If you want, I can help you structure practices, routines, or reflection exercises to shift these patterns over time — or go deeper into any of these threads.






---


You’re not just an anxious-preoccupied person in romance; it’s a template that colors all your bonds, ambitions, and even your sense of self. But you’re not stuck — and your depth, when wielded with boundaries and self-trust, is a rare and powerful gift.


Let me know if you want specifics on shifting toward secure attachment, or want to dive even deeper into any area (family, work, friendships, creative drive, etc).
