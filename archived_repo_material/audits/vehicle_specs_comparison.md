# Vehicle Specification Audit: The "Height Hack"

## 1. The Constraint
*   **Problem:** Many older Bangkok condos (Zone A) have loading dock clearances of **2.1 meters or less**.
*   **Standard Fleet:** Isuzu NPR 150 (Yellow Plate) has a cab height of ~2.26m and a cage height often exceeding 2.5m.
*   **Risk:** Rejection at site survey (~30% of buildings).

## 2. Vehicle Options Analysis

| Feature | Isuzu NPR 150 (The Workhorse) | Toyota Hilux Revo (Standard Cab) | Suzuki Carry (The Basement Hero) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payload** | 2,000 - 3,000 kg | 1,500 kg (Leaf Spring Mod) | 945 kg |
| **Height (Cab)** | 2.26 m | 1.70 m | **1.89 m** |
| **Cage Volume** | High (~10-12 m3) | Medium (~6 m3) | Low (~4 m3) |
| **Fuel** | Diesel | Diesel | Gasoline / LPG |
| **Cost (New)** | ~700k + Cage | ~580k + Mod | ~385k + Cage |
| **Ideal Use** | Main Route (Street Loading) | Mixed Route | **Low Clearance Basements** |

## 3. Recommendation: Mixed Fleet Strategy
We cannot rely solely on the NPR. We must introduce a **"Rescue Unit"** for Year 1.

### The "Low Profile" Configuration
*   **Chassis:** **Toyota Hilux Revo Standard Cab**.
*   **Modification:** "Fence" style cage (not full box) ensuring max height <2.1m.
*   **Operation:** Used for "Feeder Runs" from low-height condos to the consolidation hub.
*   **Trade-off:** Requires 2 trips for every 1 NPR trip. Driver cost remains same.

## 4. Action Item
*   **Ops Plan Update:** Define "Feeder Routes" for Suzuki/Hilux units.
*   **Site Survey:** If height <2.2m, assign to "Low Profile" route immediately.
