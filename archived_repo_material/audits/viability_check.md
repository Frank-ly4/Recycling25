# Financial Viability Audit

## Executive Summary
**Status: VIABLE but TIGHT.**
The financial model (90 THB fee, 60k profit target) is grounded in real Bangkok market mechanics, specifically the BMA's "Split Fee" regulation. The targets are realistic but require strict adherence to the "Cluster Logistics" strategy to maintain margins.

## 1. Pricing Viability (90 THB/Unit)
*   **The Anchor:** BMA Ordinance (2019) sets waste fees at **80 THB/month** (mixed) vs **20 THB/month** (separated).
*   **The Value Prop:** A condo paying 80 THB to BMA saves 60 THB by hiring us. Our 90 THB fee is a net cost of **30 THB/unit** after compliance savings.
*   **Budget Impact:** Typical Condo Common Fee is ~1,500 THB/month (50 THB/sqm x 30sqm). Our fee (90 THB) represents **6%** of the Juristic budget. This is a "Major Line Item" but approvable for ESG/Compliance value.

## 2. Cost Realism
*   **Labor (25k Driver):** **REALISTIC.** Standard delivery drivers earn 15-18k. Paying 25k ensures "Service Mindset" (uniforms, polite) required for premium condos.
*   **Vehicle (28k Lease):** **REALISTIC.** Used Isuzu NPRs cost ~500k. A commercial lease/finance payment is ~15-20k. 28k allows for insurance + maintenance buffer.
*   **Fuel (6k/month):** **CONSERVATIVE.** At 30 THB/L diesel, this buys 200L (1,600 km). A 5km cluster route uses <500 km/month. Ample buffer.

## 3. Targets & Upside
*   **Profit Target (60k @ 9 Bldgs):** **ACHIEVABLE.**
    *   Revenue: 324k (9 * 36k).
    *   Fixed Costs: ~150k.
    *   Variable: ~100k.
    *   Net: ~70k.
*   **Hidden Upside:** The model assumes **0 THB** from material sales.
    *   Reality: 3,600 units * 2kg/mo * 10 THB/kg (PET price) = **72,000 THB/month** in pure margin upside.
    *   *Recommendation:* Keep this off the P&L to impress investors later ("Sandbagging").

## 4. Critical Risks
*   **Regulation Delay:** If BMA delays the 80 THB penalty enforcement again, the "Cost Savings" pitch weakens.
*   **Mitigation:** Lean heavily on **Corporate ESG** (Sansiri/AP Net Zero goals) which exists regardless of BMA law.
