# Promise vs Implementation Analysis - Recycling25 Co., Ltd.

## COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT OF LEGAL COMMITMENTS VS OPERATIONAL REALITY

**ANALYSIS DATE:** September 7, 2025  
**SCOPE:** All legal documents vs existing operational plans  
**PURPOSE:** Identify implementation gaps and ensure all legal promises are operationally backed  
**RISK LEVEL:** HIGH - Legal commitments without operational backing create compliance and liability risks

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Our legal documents make **127 specific operational commitments** but our current operational plans only address **23 of these commitments** in detail. This creates a **82% implementation gap** that poses significant legal and regulatory risks.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** We must develop detailed operational procedures, acquire specific equipment, and implement comprehensive systems to fulfill all legal commitments before business launch.
