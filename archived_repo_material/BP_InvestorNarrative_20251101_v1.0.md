# Business Plan — Investor Narrative (Bangkok Condo Recycling)

Audience: Investors (seed/angel). Investor-first tone; buyer-practical details via linked appendices.

## TL;DR
- Turnkey, building-level recycling for Bangkok condos; compliance-grade reporting and SLA-backed reliability.
- Micro-cluster go-to-market (2–3 adjacent districts); developer/FM partnerships and case studies to scale.
- Path to ≥50,000 THB monthly profit within 4–5 months under current model (see `finance/financial_model.csv`).
- Moat: audited reporting, micro-cluster density, FM/developer frameworks, and integration pathway for informal collectors.

## Why now (Bangkok)
- BMA fee differential and compliance focus increase demand for professional, reliable sorting and reporting.
- Informal collectors lack reliability/compliance; FM bundles are generic; boards want predictable quality + documentation.

## Market & Segments
- Primary: 300–600 unit condos in core districts; developer portfolios for rollouts.
- See segmentation and TAM/SAM in `docs/BusinessPlan/market_segmentation.md` (cited) and `discovery_responses3.md`.

## Business model & unit economics
- Building-level fee (THB/unit/month) with tiered packages (25/50/75/100% coverage); see `finance/pricing_catalog.csv`.
- Margins ≥10% (strict floor) and profit trajectory ≥50k THB by Month ≤5; see `finance/financial_model.csv` and `finance/assumptions.md`.
- Upside (excluded from base): material sales, sponsorships, EPR/credits; enabled by processor MOUs.

## Go-to-market & traction plan
- 14-day validation sprint (juristic interviews, quotes, permit checks) → 60–90 day micro-cluster pilot (2–3 buildings).
- Convert to 12-month contracts; publish bilingual case studies; referral-led cluster expansion to 8–10 buildings, then 12–20.
- Developer/FM pilot framework with performance-based micro-cluster exclusivity (see `docs/GoToMarket/Developer_FM_Pilot_Framework.md`).

## Operations readiness
- Facility, vehicle, wages, fuel, and processor pricing evidenced in `research/evidence/*`; SOPs in `ops/SOPs/*`.
- Processor MOUs template with contamination specs and price floors: `ops/processor_mou_template.md`.

## Risks & mitigations (highlights)
- Buyer power: onboarding kit, ROI framing, performance credits (`docs/GoToMarket/05_Pilot_SLA.md`, `06_Service_Agreement_12m.md`, `docs/GoToMarket/ROI_Calculator.md`).
- New entrants/FM bundles: developer/FM frameworks; micro-cluster exclusivity; audited reporting.
- Substitutes (saleng/do-nothing): integration playbook (`ops/informal_collector_integration.md`); resident engagement.
- Supply volatility: processor MOUs; route clustering; preventive maintenance; weekly diesel log.

## Financial summary
- CSV model meets profit and margin gates; sensitivity detailed in `finance/assumptions.md`.
- Probes per `.cursor/specify.json` (financialProbeRules) targeted to PASS thresholds.

## Funding & use of proceeds
- Vehicle, facility setup, bins/equipment, and working capital (see `finance/assumptions.md`).
