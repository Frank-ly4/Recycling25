## Business Plan — Bangkok Condo Recycling Service

### 1. TL;DR
- Concept: Turn-key, fee-based recycling service for Bangkok condominiums. Fees are primary revenue; material sales are bonus. Compliance and reporting are core value.
- Targets: Break-even at ~4–6 large condos (~400 units) at 80–100 THB/unit/month; comfortable at 8–10. Cluster routes in 2–3 adjacent districts.
- Legal: Thai-majority Ltd now; BOI promotion in parallel; Social Enterprise certification for investor tax advantages. BMA permit (Public Health Act), DLT vehicle registration; no DIW factory license if <50 hp & <50 employees.
- Ask: Tranche-based seed to execute 60–90 day pilot (vehicle, bins, facility deposit, working capital).

### 2. Problem/Why Now & Market (Bangkok)
- BMA “No Mixed Waste” fee structure (20 vs 60 THB) creates compliance incentive; condos need a reliable solution with minimal staff burden.
- Informal sector and free programs exist but are unreliable/limited scope; professional turn-key service plus reporting fills the gap.

### 3. Solution and differentiation
- Weekly pickup, bins/signage, resident engagement, monthly ESG report; optional e-waste days. SLA-backed reliability, data transparency, compliance documentation.
- Zone clustering, SOPs, and simple tech (route optimization, data capture) to keep unit economics efficient.

### 4. Pricing (Building-level)
- Primary revenue: building-level fee 80–100 THB/unit/month (300–600 unit condos). Alternative: lump-sum per building or reduced-fee + limited revenue share.
- Service tiers (100% billed): 25% tier @75 THB (6 buildings needed); 50% tier @90 THB (5 buildings); 75% tier @100 THB (4 buildings); 100% tier @110 THB (4 buildings).
- Packages/blocks: optional subscription by unit blocks (e.g., 100-unit blocks) with a micro‑cluster baseline (e.g., ≥300 units across ≥2 buildings). If collected volume exceeds included thresholds, auto‑upgrade to next block; overage or extra collections priced as add‑ons.
- Bonus revenue: materials sale (baled PET/HDPE/paper); future EPR/plastic credits; corporate sponsorships.

### 5. Operations
- Vehicle: non-compacting box/cage truck (Isuzu FRR 210 or smaller N-series if access constraints). Fuel ~9.5–15k THB/mo with tight clustering.
- Facility: 150–300 m² compliant warehouse; manual/semi-automated sorting; baler when volume warrants. SOPs for H&S, contamination control, and chain-of-custody.
- Staffing: driver + loader; shared sorting early; training, PPE, performance incentives; small bench.

### 6. Legal and compliance
- Thai-majority Ltd immediately; BOI application in parallel; Social Enterprise certification (≥70% reinvestment) to enable 100% investor tax deduction.
- BMA District “Business Detrimental to Health” permit; PDPA data/privacy policy; DLT vehicle registration/insurance; Social Security registration.

### 7. Traction Plan & Go-To-Market
- ICP: 300–600 unit condos in Sukhumvit/Sathorn/Phaya Thai. 30–60 day pilot → 12-month contract. Case studies and referrals to scale clusters.
- Sales kit: one-pager, bilingual deck, sample ESG report, pilot SLA, 12-month service agreement.

### 8. Financials (assumptions to validate)
- Monthly module cost: 150–160k THB (vehicle 50k, fuel 10–15k, labor 45–70k, facility 20–30k, misc 5–10k).
- Revenue example: 5×400 units×90 THB ≈ 180k fees + 10–30k materials = 190–210k THB.
- Sensitivities: competitor undercut (–30%) is primary risk; fuel and PET swings secondary; building-level fees buffer participation variance.

### 9. Risks and mitigations
- Undercut: SLA, compliance ROI vs BMA fee, referrals. Processor terms: spec sheets and MOUs; baling for premiums.
- Participation: in-unit bags/floor bins, education, incentives, feedback; optional Trash Lucky integration.
- Cash flow: deposits, Net-15, tranche funding; lean capex.
- PR/compliance: crisis comms, insurance, PDPA, documented chain-of-custody.

#### Mitigation Actions (90-day plan)
- Distribution moat: execute developer/FM pilot with micro-cluster focus; evaluate limited exclusivity tied to performance. See `discovery_responses5.md`.
- Buyer power: include ROI calculator (BMA fee avoidance, risk reduction), standard onboarding kit (signage/assets), and performance credits in contracts.
- Suppliers: secure 2–3 processor MOUs with contamination specs/floors; prioritize local vehicle purchase and preventive maintenance plan.
- Substitutes: integrate informal collectors for small buildings via subcontract/buy-back or hiring; publish reliability/compliance and monthly ESG dashboards.
- Evidence cadence: collect 3 facility quotes; vehicle/insurance quotes; weekly diesel log; link all in `research/evidence/**/*`.

### 10. Roadmap & Ask
 - 14-day validation sprint (outreach, LOIs, specs/quotes, legal scoping).
 - 60–90 day pilot (3–5 buildings), convert to 12-month contracts; publish case studies.
 - Tranche-based investor raise for vehicle/facility and working capital; scale clusters to 8–10 buildings; then 15–20.
