Comprehensive Due Diligence Questions for Angel Investment in a Bangkok-Based Condominium Plastic Bottle Recycling Startup

Introduction

I'm considering investing $1–2 million in a Bangkok-based recycling startup focused on collecting plastic water bottles from condominium buildings presents both significant opportunities and complex risks. Thailand’s plastic waste crisis is acute, with the country ranking among the world’s top contributors to ocean plastic pollution. The government, private sector, and civil society are mobilizing to address this challenge, and the recycling sector is evolving rapidly in response to regulatory, technological, and market shifts. However, the sector’s complexity—spanning informal labor, regulatory hurdles, fluctuating commodity prices, and evolving consumer behavior—demands rigorous due diligence.

This here provides a robust, categorized list of due diligence questions that I would like answered before committing capital. Please answer only using information from your documents/plan so far.  If there's anything outstanding, please update the document to reflect further research/clarification/math/etc. is needed. The questions are organized under clear headings, each reflecting a critical area of business viability and investment risk. Each section is informed by current market data, regulatory frameworks, operational realities, and best practices in both Thai and international recycling sectors.

Market Opportunity

What is the estimated volume of PET bottles generated per condominium per month, and how does this vary across different districts or building demographics?

How many condominiums are there in Bangkok, and what percentage have existing recycling programs or contracts with competitors?

What are the current collection and recycling rates for plastic bottles in Bangkok’s residential sector, and how do these compare to national averages?

What are the key drivers of growth in the Bangkok plastic bottle recycling market (e.g., regulatory changes, consumer awareness, government incentives)?

How does the business plan to expand beyond condominiums (e.g., to office buildings, hotels, schools), and what is the potential market size for these segments?

What are the main barriers to entry for new players in the Bangkok plastic bottle collection market?

How is the market expected to evolve over the next 5–10 years in terms of volume, pricing, and regulatory requirements?

What is the impact of recent government initiatives (e.g., BMA’s “No Mixed Waste” program, waste separation fee incentives) on the market opportunity?

How does the business plan to capture market share from informal collectors and established waste management companies?

Analysis: Bangkok’s condominium sector is a major generator of plastic waste, with over 600,000 units and a growing urban population. The city’s new waste separation regulations and financial incentives for source separation are creating a more favorable environment for organized recycling businesses. However, the market remains fragmented, with significant competition from informal collectors (“saleng”) and established recycling firms. Understanding the precise size and accessibility of the target market is essential for assessing scalability and revenue potential.

Business Model and Revenue Streams
What is the core business model: direct collection and resale of bottles, provision of collection services to condominiums, or integrated recycling (collection plus processing)?

What are the primary revenue streams (e.g., sale of PET bottles to recyclers, service fees from condominiums, carbon credits, data services)?

How are prices for collected PET bottles determined, and how volatile are these prices?

How does the business plan to retain customers and prevent churn, especially as competitors enter the market?

What is the projected revenue mix over the next five years, and how does this align with market trends?

Analysis: Successful recycling startups in Thailand often blend multiple revenue streams, including material sales, service contracts, and impact monetization (e.g., through plastic credits or ESG partnerships). The volatility of PET prices and the need for long-term, stable contracts with condominiums are critical considerations. Innovative models—such as gamified recycling, smart bins, and data-driven ESG reporting—are emerging and can differentiate the business.

Unit Economics and Financial Metrics
What are the key unit economics for the business (e.g., cost per kilogram collected, revenue per kilogram, gross margin per collection route)?

How are bad debts, payment delays, or contract disputes accounted for in financial planning?

What are the key financial KPIs tracked by management (e.g., EBITDA, ROIC, customer lifetime value)?

Analysis: Unit economics in recycling are highly sensitive to collection efficiency, contamination rates, and commodity price volatility. Detailed modeling of costs and margins is essential, especially given the thin margins typical in the sector. Investors should scrutinize assumptions about collection volumes, contamination, and price stability.
