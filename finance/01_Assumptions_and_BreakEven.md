## Financial assumptions and break-even

Baseline monthly module cost (~150–160k THB)
- Vehicle capex/lease+maint+insur ~50k
- Fuel 10–15k (clustered routes)
- Labor 45–70k (driver, loader, light sorting, admin)
- Facility 20–30k (150–300 m²) + utilities
- Misc/overhead 5–10k

Revenue examples
- 5×400 units×90 THB = 180k fees + 10–30k materials = 190–210k (break-even cleared)
- Comfortable zone: 8–10 buildings; new truck threshold ~12–15 weekly pickups dependent on frequency

Sensitivity levers
- Undercut (–30% fee) → protect with SLA/value; mix to lump-sum building pricing if needed
- Fuel spikes → route optimization; fuel surcharge clause
- PET price swings → fees-first model; baling for grade premiums; offtake MOUs
