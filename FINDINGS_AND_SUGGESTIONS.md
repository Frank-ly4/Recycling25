## 1\. Key Research Findings (as of 2024-07-26)

*   **Financials (Manager Salary):** A realistic market salary for a capable Thai Operations Manager is **50,000 - 70,000 THB/month**. The initial 30k estimate is too low for a candidate who can handle clients and regulations.
*   **Legal (Foreign Ownership):** Attempting to get a direct **Foreign Business License (FBL)** is not recommended due to its complexity and unpredictable outcome. The most viable paths for 100% foreign ownership are **Board of Investment (BOI) promotion** (which is often favorable to green/recycling businesses) or structuring as a **Thai-majority company (51%+ Thai ownership)**.
*   **Legal (Social Enterprise):** Structuring as a certified **Social Enterprise (SE)** is a powerful option. It provides significant tax incentives for corporate investors (100% deduction on investment), making fundraising easier. However, it requires reinvesting at least 70% of profits and capping investor dividends at 30%.
*   **Legal (Factory License):** A full factory license (**Ror.Ngor.4**) is **not required** for a small-scale sorting facility with fewer than 50 employees and less than 50 horsepower of machinery. However, local permits from the **Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA)** for public health and waste storage will still be necessary.
*   **Impact Metrics (Water Pollution):** Bangkok's waterways are heavily polluted. The Chao Phraya River system discharges an estimated **4,000-9,300 metric tons** of plastic into the ocean annually. This provides a strong, data-backed benchmark for our environmental impact.
*   **Funding (NGOs):** "Second Life" is not a direct funding source but a social enterprise that sells **plastic credits**. They provide an excellent model to emulate for a future revenue stream but are not a source of initial seed funding for a non-coastal project.

## 2\. Strategic Suggestions (Updated)

*   **Business Model:**
    *   **Confirm:** Double down on the **service-fee-first model**. Material resale is a bonus, not the core business. This is validated by research showing the unsustainability of models reliant on volatile commodity prices.
    *   **Action:** Position the service as a premium, "turn-key" solution for condos, emphasizing **regulatory compliance, sustainability reporting, and enhanced property image** to justify the fees.

*   **Financials & Operations:**
    *   **Action:** Update the financial model to reflect a more realistic Operations Manager salary of **~50,000 THB/month**.
    *   **Action:** Revise the break-even analysis based on this updated cost structure. The target of 240,000 THB/month in revenue still seems appropriate to provide a healthy margin.

*   **Legal & Corporate Structure:**
    *   **Priority Action:** The immediate legal priority is to decide between two paths: **(A) seeking BOI promotion** or **(B) finding a trusted Thai majority partner**. Legal consultation should be sought to compare the timelines, costs, and benefits of each.
    *   **Recommendation:** Pursue registration as a **Social Enterprise** in parallel with the primary legal structure. The benefits for fundraising are too significant to ignore, and it aligns perfectly with the business's core mission.

*   **Fundraising & Pitching:**
    *   **Action:** Leverage the waterway plastic pollution data (**9,300 tons/year**) in all pitch materials to create a powerful, data-driven impact narrative.
    *   **Action:** When pitching to corporate investors, highlight the **100% tax deduction** benefit they can receive by investing in a certified Social Enterprise.
